1
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,839
This paper will deal with a problem

2
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,709
which is quite acute now as it was 

3
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,045
3500 years ago-

4
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,047
of leadership.

5
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,551
And it will be limited

6
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,055
restricted to this sidra Beha’alotcha.

7
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,724
which is one of the most difficult sidras

8
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,461
in the entire Chumash in the entire Pentateuch.

9
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,199
The sidra of Beha'alotcha is very puzzling.

10
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,703
it is puzzling for two reasons.

11
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,372
First

12
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,876
certain events described in the sidra

13
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,579
are incomprehensible.

14
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,949
We simply do not know

15
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:03,456
why they happened, the etiology of those events,

16
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726
and what purpose

17
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,262
were they pursuing.

18
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,537
I'll give you just an example. What I want to

19
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,744
explain. We do not understand the story about Miriam,

20
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,781
Miriam's criticism of Moses. Her disapproval.

21
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,985
It is hard to grasp

22
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,387
that Miriam,

23
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:40,226
the devoted and loyal sister who as a little girl

24
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,228
stood alone

25
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:49,034
on the shore of the Nile, to watch the floating ark,

26
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,406
because she had faith and hope,

27
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
as far as her brother is concerned,

28
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,144
her little brother

29
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,348
the baby in the ark, while all adults

30
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:07,319
including the mother and father, resigned and

31
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,621
abandoned the baby.

32
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,663
This sister

33
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,166
it is quite puzzling

34
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,536
should suddenly turn into an accuser?

35
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,572
Into prosecuting attorney?

36
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,308
Of her great brother.

37
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:32,945
Strange

38
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,949
Equally un-understandable

39
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:42,154
incomprehensible, is the strictness and the sadness

40
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,126
and the speed with which the Almighty meted out

41
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,060
the punishment.

42
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,568
Equally difficult to grasp,

43
00:13:55,568 --> 00:14:00,639
is the connection between this episode and the tragedy

44
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,574
which

45
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,810
which was recorded in the Torah

46
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,013
prior to the description of the Miriam episode,

47
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,050
namely the tragedy of “Kivrot haTa’avah”

48
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,855
of the graves of the voluptuaries.

49
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,860
This is one difficulty.

50
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,195
There is a second difficulty.

51
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,066
Moses went through many crises.

52
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:34,673
he lived through many distressful experiences

53
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,774
and moments.

54
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,245
The worst of all, you understand

55
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,614
you know that- was the Egel (Golden Calf).

56
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,354
Experience which threatened to terminate the very

57
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,623
relationship between God and Israel.

58
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,427
Yet he was never panicked.

59
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,903
He never did act out of despair, black despair.

60
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,538
He never complained.

61
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:13,012
On the contrary, steadfastly and heroically,

62
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,614
he petition the Almighty for forgiveness.

63
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,183
Defending like an attorney

64
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,420
in the court, defending

65
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,856
the people, arguing their case.

66
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:29,328
Chazal express themselves by using a metaphor:

67
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,030
Vay’chal Moshe

68
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,902
Vay'chal in contradistinction to vay'ivakesh.

69
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,238
In contradistinction to

70
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,142
Vayitchanen Moshe,

71
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,947
emphasizes the element of strength and boldness.

72
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,385
There is both prayer and there is prayer,

73
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:58,991
humble prayer. Vay'chal has the connotation of both prayer

74
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,760
so Chazal say in a very strange metaphor

75
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,228
but it's a beautiful metaphor,

76
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:19,912
Moses seized the corner of the mantle (kaveyachol) of the Almighty

77
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,414
he said I will not let you loose

78
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,218
unless you forgive the sin of the people.

79
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,027
Suddenly,

80
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,531
Moshe began to complain in our sidra.

81
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:46,972
When the "asafsuf", the multitude began to rebel,

82
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,607
Moshe,

83
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,511
instead of defending the people, began to complain

84
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,380
almost accusing the people.

85
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,851
He even said things

86
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,287
which were never uttered.

87
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:08,093
“And Moshe said to Hashem: Why have you treated your servant so badly? 

88
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,963
Why have I not found favor in your sight, 

89
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,999
that you lay the burden of all this people on me? 

90
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,637
I am not able to carry all this people alone, for they are too heavy for me. 

91
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,439
If this is the way you are going to treat me, 

92
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,176
put me to death at once if I have found favor in your sight and do not let me see my misery.”

93
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:29,181
Words which have never been uttered by Moses.

94
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,253
Yes, a similar phrase he uttered,

95
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,556
when he was sent to Pharaoh

96
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,430
on his first errand,

97
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,167
and his mission ended in complete failure.

98
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,937
So he came back to Hakadosh Baruch Hu, and he said

99
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:57,509
"Why have you mistreated this people? Why did you ever send me?"

100
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,712
However he never repeated his question.

101
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,649
It was a question of the young,

102
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,885
a man who is not experienced.

103
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,254
But Moshe as the leader

104
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,323
who took the Jews out of Egypt,

105
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,791
never repeated this question.

106
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,895
it is not Moshe like,

107
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,369
to act like a frightened

108
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:31,410
person and to speak out of the depths of resignation

109
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,349
as if he were... and to condemn the people.

110
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,990
However, this I gave you two examples

111
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,460
of events which require interpretation to understand.

112
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,630
We have to study Chumash the way we study Gemara.

113
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,765
You have to analyze, conceptualize the Chumash,

114
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,805
and find in every verse the meaning

115
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,674
the connotation, 

116
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:09,915
and actually the tenet, the principle.

117
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,753
However, the most difficult problem with Beha'alotcha,

118
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,756
is not so much

119
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,126
is not limited to the substance of events

120
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,264
as depth of continuity of the sidra.

121
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,370
At first glance we are perplexed by the lack

122
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,606
of systematic development of the story

123
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,209
which the Torah was trying to tell us.

124
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,615
The latter (the Torah) is always

125
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,352
was always careful

126
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:53,225
about continuity and wholeness of the narrative. 

127
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,093
The Torah never tells us half a story.

128
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,330
There's always development, transition,

129
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:03,235
complete narration.  When the Torah is finished with

130
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,903
the story, the story is complete.

131
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,012
However, as far as Beha'alotcha is concerned, we don't know.  We don't know

132
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,215
how many stories there are in Beha'alotcha.

133
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,150
How many stories are complete,

134
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,718
how many are incomplete.

135
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,221
And simply you don't see the continuity.

136
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,425
We don't see the thread of continuity in Beha'alotcha.

137
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,897
Let us just simply review Beha'alotcha.

138
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,802
The events which were recorded in the sidra of Beha'alotcha.

139
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,910
It starts, Beha'alotcha commences,

140
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,413
with what?  With the sanctification of the Levites.

141
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,584
Beha'alotcha took some psukim to the Menorah,

142
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,519
Chazal were right that

143
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,355
Beha'alotcha et haNerot (the Mitzvah of the Menorah)

144
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,124
actually belongs in parshat Naso.

145
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,728
That’s what Rashi wanted to convey when he said: Aharon became upset

146
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,031
So indeed, the sidre of Beha'alotcha

147
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,567
begins with the kiddush HaLeviim (sanctification of the Levites).

148
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,869
“and you shall present them as an elevation offering”

149
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,307
Then the Torah

150
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,843
tells us

151
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,047
about what? 

152
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,751
What follows the kiddush HaLeviim?

153
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,788
Pesach Sheni

154
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,291
It is Pesach baShana haShenit (Pesach in the second year)

155
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,059
and Pesach Sheni.

156
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,163
Halakhically, Pesach Sheni

157
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,665
refers to the Pesach

158
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,199
which is offered in Iyar.

159
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,670
by the one who is far away and the one who is impure (at the time of the first Pesach).

160
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,073
But here the story is of the Pesach baShana haShenit

161
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,810
baShana haShenit.

162
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,548
And of course the Torah is recorded 

163
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,619
within the framework of the Pesach baShana haShenit,

164
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,888
the incident with the tmei'im (impure ones).

165
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,991
They approached Moshe,

166
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,427
"why must we be kept from presenting Hashem’s offering 

167
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,395
at its appointed time among the Israelites?"

168
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,798
And Moshe inquired of the Almighty,

169
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,134
and the institution of Pesach Sheni was established.

170
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,574
Where is the transition from the kiddush haleviim

171
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,409
to Pesach beShana haShenit?

172
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,578
We don't know.

173
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,349
Two different stories,

174
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,250
there is no continuous development.

175
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,555
Then following the description of

176
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:40,592
Peshach beShana haShenit and Pesach Sheni,

177
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,730
we have another description.

178
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,298
Of what?

179
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,568
Of the cloud. The Amud Ha'anan,

180
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,637
guiding the people on their journey.

181
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,014
There is no transition from the story about the Pesach,

182
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,451
to the story about Amud Ha'anan.

183
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,553
And the Torah tells us in detail

184
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,256
how the journeys of the Bnei Yisrael

185
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,958
are completely dependent

186
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,794
upon the position of Amud Ha'anan.

187
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:27,773
"Whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, then the Israelites would set out…"

188
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,411
Following the narrative about the anan,

189
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:37,082
the Torah relates to us

190
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,653
the commandment pertaining to Chatzotzrot.

191
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,988
The two trumpets.

192
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,591
And their use for assembling the community

193
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,860
and the journeying of the camps.

194
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,431
And the Torah describes almost in detail

195
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,132
the signal system

196
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,302
connected with the Chatzotzrot.

197
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,572
One blast, one camp moved,

198
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,809
another blast, a second camp moved.

199
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,011
I mean the T’ruah, the T’ki’ah.

200
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,956
At the conclusion of the section

201
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,791
dealing with the chatzotzrot,

202
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,960
What does the Torah do?

203
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,197
The Torah resumes the previous theme.

204
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,933
The journeying of the machanes (camps).

205
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:29,901
And again

206
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,438
tells us in detail the order in which the camps travel.

207
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,742
Judah at the head,

208
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,846
Followed by Yisachar and so forth.

209
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,919
Then, after the Torah describes

210
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,488
the organization of the machanes,

211
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,090
and how they moved from spot to spot

212
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,158
how they traveled,

213
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,394
suddenly we are 

214
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,764
we hear the very strange conversation

215
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,334
which actually I mean

216
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,835
prima facie

217
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,072
is puzzling and enigmatic.

218
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,377
a conversation between Moses and his father in law

219
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,720
Moses extending an invitation to his father in law,

220
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,689
but humbly extended.

221
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,292
"And you will serve as eyes for us. 

222
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,327
Moreover, if you go with us, whatever good Hashem does for us, 

223
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,196
the same we will do for you."

224
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,266
Moshe arguing with his father in law.

225
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,434
He wants his father in law to leave Midyan,

226
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,837
and to join the Bnei Yisrael,

227
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,339
but Yitro is a bit stubborn.

228
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,377
Fine.

229
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,646
Following the conversation,

230
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,082
we suddenly

231
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,322
we suddenly are confronted

232
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,860
with a parsha consisting of two psukim.

233
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,495
Vay’hi bin’soa ha’aron… – Whenever the ark set out, 

234
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,696
Moses would say,  [Arise, Hashem, let your enemies be scattered, 

235
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,830
and your foes flee before you.”] 

236
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,032
"And whenever it came to rest, he would say, [Return, Hashem

237
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,033
of the ten thousand thousands of Israel].”

238
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,534
Two psukim.

239
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,770
At the beginning of the parsha there

240
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,239
there is an inverted noon.

241
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,776
At the end of the parsha there is an inverted noon.

242
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,549
In order to emphasize that this parsha is out of context here.

243
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,818
Indeed, it is out of context.

244
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,989
And the question is obvious.

245
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,659
What is the question? If it's out of context

246
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,728
so why should should the parsha

247
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,131
why did the Torah insert the parsha in the

248
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,368
in the in the place or into a section,

249
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,506
within which the parsha would always stand out

250
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,376
as out of context.

251
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,713
The parsha could have been beautifully inserted.

252
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,081
You know where?

253
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,283
Where could this parsha be inserted?

254
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,720
At the end of Pekudei.

255
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,056
At the end of Exodus.

256
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,460
"For the cloud of Hashem was on the tabernacle by day, 

257
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,196
and fire was in the cloud by night, 

258
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:15,033
before the eyes of all the house of Israel at each stage of their journey."

259
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,869
The two psukim

260
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,774
would have been the most appropriate conclusion or sequel to that.

261
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,844
"Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, 

262
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,279
Arise, Hashem, let your enemies be scattered, and your foes flee before you.” 

263
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,848
"And whenever it came to rest, he would say, 

264
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,218
 Return, Hashem of the ten thousand thousands of Israel.”

265
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,056
And finally,

266
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,494
following the parsha of Vay’hi bin’soa ha’aron,

267
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:47,532
the Torah tells us the tragic story. Very tragic story.

268
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,934
We will analyze this story.

269
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,137
Of the Kivrot haTa’avah.

270
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:55,407
Of the people who desired. They didn't do anything else.

271
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,510
No crime, no avoda zara, no retsicha.

272
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,145
No giluy arayot.

273
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,579
No gezayla, no genayva.

274
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,281
Nothing.

275
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,717
They hadn't raised their voices.

276
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,020
They just were overcome by a desire.

277
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,990
And they wept.  That's all.

278
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,425
They didn't yell.

279
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,161
They didn't throw stones at Moses.

280
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,269
Like their actions in other situations.

281
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,137
Nothing.  They didn't say anything.

282
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,573
They were not threatening anybody.

283
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,942
Just complaining.

284
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,745
People have a desire. 

285
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,347
This tragic story is told

286
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,219
and the name Kivrot haTa’avah

287
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,490
could have been invented today

288
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,995
to characterize, to portray, modern man.

289
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,598
It is the grave of the desire.

290
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:57,202
The grave which man digs for himself.

291
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,037
Or I would rather say,

292
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,308
the grave which the desire digs for man.

293
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,783
The grave of the voluptuaries.

294
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,951
And finally

295
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,220
the conclusion of the sidra is

296
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,989
the story of Miriam.

297
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,162
We simply are perplexed.

298
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,298
How many stories are in Beha'alotcha?

299
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,739
One story or several stories? Or many stories?

300
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,574
What do you think?

301
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,881
Several? I'm not asking for the number.

302
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:43,882
It will be wrong

303
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,551
whatever number you mention.

304
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,721
But I'm asking one or many?

305
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,024
If it's one, there must be transition;

306
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,492
If there is no transition,

307
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,829
there is no gradual and systematic development

308
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,398
of a theme, there is no unity.

309
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,535
Whoever writes a composition paper,

310
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,270
in first year of English,

311
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,338
knows there must be unity!

312
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,542
Unity is when a theme is developed.

313
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:17,448
Prima Facie there is no development of anything, there is no unity.

314
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,883
There's no literary unity.

315
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,819
There are many stories.

316
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,690
But each story per se is half a story, not a complete story.

317
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,599
With you, I mean when I

318
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,569
as a matter of fact whatever I'll tell you tonight

319
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,503
I mean I

320
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,506
occurred to me during kriyat haTorah on Shabbos.

321
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,842
It's completely new.  You wouldn't find it.

322
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,980
No one plagiarized me yet.

323
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:55,386
I'm just reviewing my thoughts with you tonight for the first time.

324
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,924
I had a feeling when the ba'al koreh 

325
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,860
was reading the sidra,

326
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,430
as if we were jumping like a bee

327
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,300
on a clear warm summer morning from flower to flower

328
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,737
accumulating the sweet nectar.

329
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,077
Is it possible let me ask you

330
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:25,583
is it possible that the principal of achdus

331
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,321
of achdus haTorah, unity of the Torah,

332
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,625
of the scenes which the Torah develops,

333
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,961
was lost in the parsha of Beha'alotcha?

334
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,297
It's an impossibility.

335
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,540
Now let me move forward and see

336
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,208
I mean of course

337
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,443
my job is

338
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,646
to restore the unity of the parsha.

339
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,648
The parsha is one story.

340
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,650
One story, a tragic story.

341
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,484
Tragic story

342
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,920
which has changed Jewish history completely.

343
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,522
From top to bottom. The inverted Nuns

344
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,859
symbolize an inverted historical process here.

345
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,329
An inverted Nun is not so bad.

346
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,365
But if history is being inverted,

347
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,137
not realized, or stopped suddenly,

348
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,905
it's very tragic.

349
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,210
Chazal speak about punishment in Beha'alotcha

350
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,480
as the worst distressful event Jewish history.

351
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,251
“In order to separate between one punishment and another punishment.”

352
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,656
Let us start with the Exodus.

353
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,358
When the almighty

354
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:45,496
charged Moshe with the assignment of redeeming

355
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,000
the

356
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,335
the Jews

357
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,605
or liberating them from Egypt

358
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,508
He told them the following words.

359
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,344
He told him many things. 

360
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,080
But the Chinuch says,

361
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:06,718
That the necessary prerequisite of the Exodus is the following sentence:

362
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:14,759
"And it shall be your sign that it was I who sent you, when you will free the people from Egypt, 

363
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,662
you shall worship Gd on this mountain."

364
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:23,835
"And it shall be your sign that it was I who sent you, 

365
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,005
when you will free the people from Egypt, 

366
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,176
you shall worship Gd on this mountain."

367
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,680
It's a difficult sentence.  Difficult verse.

368
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,382
In other words,

369
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,086
I'm utilizing, plagiarizing the Ba'al Hachinuch,

370
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,357
In other words, the Almighty told Moses 

371
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:52,196
that the Exodus drama will culminate 

372
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,999
in two events:

373
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,670
"You shall worship Gd on this mountain."

374
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,974
How many events does this encompass?

375
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,843
"You shall worship Gd on this mountain."

376
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,845
How many events?

377
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,518
It means that the Exodus

378
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,286
will not be consummated

379
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:21,125
until you worship Gd at this mountain.

380
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,161
What does Gd mean by it? 

381
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,463
Worship Gd at this mountain.

382
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,265
What did He mean by it?

383
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,002
What did Moshe understand by these words?

384
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,404
"Worship Gd at this mountain."

385
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,640
Very simply, what does it mean?

386
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,810
So the Chinuch says,

387
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,179
he meant two things.

388
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,482
First of all Matan Torah, 

389
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,884
the giving of the law.

390
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,354
The Torah teaches man how to worship Gd.

391
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,690
The continuous worship of Gd.

392
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,029
The Man who lives according to the principles and rules of the Torah

393
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,798
is a steady worshipper of Gd.

394
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,367
There is no neutral moment;

395
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,437
worship is a continuous process.

396
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,173
However, he meant something else,

397
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,908
Namely what?

398
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,845
The construction of the Mishkan.

399
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,683
Certainly within the purpose of the Mishkan,

400
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,651
Is what?  Is the worship

401
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,189
as a matter of fact the Torah was given at 

402
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,459
at the Mount Sinai

403
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,229
and the Mishkan was constructed when?

404
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:35,299
immediately after Moses came down from the

405
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,401
from the mountain

406
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,407
and immediately Betzalel started

407
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,409
the work of constructing the Mishkan

408
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,279
on the day or the following day after Moses

409
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,648
I mean came down from the mountain

410
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,517
assembled the people

411
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,587
and told them that the Mishkan should be constructed.

412
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,061
It's no wonder that

413
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,963
following the 10 Commandments,

414
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,166
following in Parshas Yisro

415
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,967
Gd mentioned

416
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:15,439
to Moses what? The construction of a mizbeach.

417
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:30,521
If the Jews hadn't succumbed to the hysteria of the Erev Rav.

418
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,661
Had they rejected the Egel,

419
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:43,267
the two objectives would have been realized much sooner.

420
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,171
Because of the Egel,

421
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:53,044
the time schedule was changed and the consummation of the

422
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,249
of "You shall worship Gd on this mountain",

423
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,985
was delayed for how many days?

424
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,720
For how many days?

425
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,655
80 days correct.

426
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,925
if the Egel had not been made and

427
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,162
and the whole tragedy of the Egel could have been avoided,

428
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,732
so Moshe would have come down on the 17th of Tamuz, 

429
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,868
and immediately

430
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,405
they would have started to construct the Mishkan.

431
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,807
Because of the Egel

432
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:27,845
Moshe had to spend on Mount Sinai, in prayer,

433
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,616
80 more days.

434
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,452
So Moshe came back from Mount Sinai,

435
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,056
The day following Yom Kippur.

436
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,527
And so the construction of the Mishkan was delayed for 80 days.

437
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:46,764
However,

438
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,467
on the day after Yom Kippur

439
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,370
after Moses came down with the second luchos,

440
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,640
and with the message of forgiveness,

441
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,309
he quickly assemble the congregation

442
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,613
and told them about the immediate task to be discharged

443
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,149
namely the binyan Beis Hamikdash.

444
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,520
The work of construction commenced immediately.

445
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,790
How long did it take them

446
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,230
to construct the Mishkan? To complete the work?

447
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:25,269
How long? The Mishkan was completed and put together

448
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,506
on the 1st of Nissan.

449
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,940
According to Chazal

450
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,111
it was the Shemini laMiluim (8th day of the Miluim handing over the priesthood to Aharon)

451
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,581
The day on which the Nesiim began to offer

452
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,384
their gifts to the

453
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,154
to the Beis Hamikdash.

454
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,157
When

455
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,662
When those two objectives. 

456
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,898
Matan Torah, 

457
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,935
and binyan Beis Hamikdash, were achieved

458
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:04,775
so the Geula found its realization.

459
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,414
"You shall worship Gd on this mountain" was translated into reality.

460
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:19,824
The people therefore had no business of prolonging

461
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,727
their stay in Midbar Sinai.

462
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,263
They stayed in Midbar Sinai as long as they wanted.

463
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:31,001
As long as it was necessary to receive the Torah.

464
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,704
The Torah had to be received twice

465
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,474
due to the Egel.

466
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:40,811
and as long as it was necessary to construct 

467
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,451
as long as it was necessary in order to complete the work on the Beis Hamikdash.

468
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,754
Because both come under the

469
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,725
are encompassed by the 

470
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:59,563
by the commandment: "Worship Gd on this mountain".

471
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,400
But the very moment

472
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,970
the second Luchos were delivered to Yisrael,

473
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,539
The Beis Hamikdash was constructed.

474
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,040
The work completed.

475
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,110
Zekenim elected,

476
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,613
and the korbanos offered,

477
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,717
so then the task of Yisrael

478
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:27,024
in Midbar Sinai was discharged and fulfilled.

479
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:32,263
There was no purpose in

480
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,200
in extending the sojourn any longer.

481
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,704
Now let us see.

482
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:46,510
The Torah in Naso tells us about the final act of the

483
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,246
of the dedication of the Mishkan.

484
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,652
Namely, the sacrifices by the Nesiim.

485
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,923
The Torah did not forget to mention

486
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,693
a secondary

487
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,468
matter like the Kiddush Haleviim.

488
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,369
The Torah

489
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:18,709
apprises us in Tzav about Kiddush Kohanim.

490
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,945
Which was a primary significance.

491
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,451
In a word, with the dedication of the Mishkan

492
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,387
by the Nesiim,

493
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,261
and the election of the Leviim,

494
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,831
everything which was necessary in order to have 

495
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,704
the Mishkan serve the great purpose of Avoda,

496
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,374
was prepared and ready. 

497
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,476
The work was completed.

498
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,546
As a matter of fact,

499
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,417
when could the Bnei Yisrael

500
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,555
simply get up and leave

501
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,559
and leave Midbar Sinai?

502
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,932
The Mishkan was completed on the 1st of Nissan.

503
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,536
12 Nesiim offered their gifts.

504
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,803
The Almighty said: 

505
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,507
"They shall present their offerings, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar…"

506
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:30,214
meaning Rosh Chodesh Nissan plus 12 days.

507
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:37,721
It means they were ready on the 13th of Nissan to march.

508
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:43,227
However the Anan (cloud) did not move, did not rise.

509
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:48,365
Because the next day was Erev Pesach.

510
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:52,803
To march Erev Pesach, tomorrow is the korban Pesach.

511
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,276
So the march was postponed until after Pesach.

512
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,982
But everybody knew 

513
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:12,623
that the stay of the Jews in Midbar Sinai

514
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,427
in the Sinai wilderness came to a close.

515
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,297
The job was done, the task discharged,

516
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:24,268
the Beis Hamikdash built, the Torah was given, 

517
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,837
now we have to resume our march.

518
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,083
However, the march was, as I said, delayed.

519
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:44,622
Until after the Jews offered the Korban Pesach.

520
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,991
The second Pesach

521
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,593
they celebrated in Midbar Sinai,

522
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:58,202
"Hashem spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year 

523
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:03,307
after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: 

524
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,943
Let the Israelites keep the passover at its appointed time." 

525
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:10,648
I postponed the journey,

526
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:15,185
Until after the Korban Pesach will be offered.

527
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,398
So why did the Torah tell us 

528
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,401
In Beha'alotcha about the Korban Pesach

529
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,769
the second year?

530
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,805
Because the Korban Pesach was the only handicap

531
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,408
the only obstacle as far as what?

532
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,110
As the resumption of the march is concerned.

533
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:52,756
And during the Hakravas HaPesach

534
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:56,894
impure people inquired about their status,

535
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,597
Moshe Rabenu asked the Almighty,

536
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,500
and the institution of Pesach Sheni was introduced.

537
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:07,838
For those who were unable to offer the Pesach

538
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,541
on the 1st of Nissan.

539
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,910
There is topic continuity. 

540
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,580
The kiddush Haleviim is the last act

541
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,249
of "You shall worship Gd on this mountain".

542
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,452
It was not as important as the kiddush HaKohanim.

543
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,721
That's why the Torah tells us about the sanctification of the Kohanim 

544
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,056
in Tzav and Tetzaveh.

545
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,725
The sanctification of the Leviim is not as important; 

546
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:32,262
you could operate the Beis HaMikdash without the Leviim.

547
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,865
Shira (the main function of the Leviim) is not indispensable;

548
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:46,677
the Leviim are more or less a luxury.

549
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:53,317
The Torah tells us that every detail was completed,

550
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,486
we were ready to march,

551
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,058
the Almighty told Moshe to offer the Pesach first in Midbar Sinai,

552
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,928
and after the Pesach was offered,

553
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,832
the B’nei Yisrael were supposed to resume their march.

554
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,168
I repeat

555
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:16,273
the two prerequisites for moving on were met.

556
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,176
The Torah given and accepted,

557
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,078
the Mishkan ready for worship.

558
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:30,053
The great march was supposed to start.

559
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:39,329
The march where?

560
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,440
There was one place they had to march.

561
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,543
Not back to Egypt.

562
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,713
The march to Eretz Yisrael.

563
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,416
All four freedoms

564
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,420
all four freedoms were attained.

565
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,189
 “I will take out…

566
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,623
I will save…

567
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,025
I will redeem…”,

568
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,894
and with Matan Torah and the construction of the Mikdash, 

569
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:14,932
the “I will take…” was realized as well.

570
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,102
The hour was struck for the fifth freedom

571
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,405
for the fifth freedom

572
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:26,510
to be realized and translated into a reality.

573
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,314
namely “I will bring (you into the land…)”.

574
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,153
Now,

575
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,558
how long was the march supposed to last?

576
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,563
What did you say?

577
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,214
A year?

578
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,450
Two years?

579
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:07,784
No.

580
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,929
A short time anyway, several days

581
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,331
We'll see how many days Chazal end up with.

582
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,066
Several days.

583
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:31,708
That's why the Torah reveals to us

584
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,912
the details of the march.

585
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,151
First, who was the guide,

586
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,619
who was the leader?

587
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,956
if you march toward a certain destination

588
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,992
particularly in the desert, you need a leader.

589
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,561
So the answer is, the Torah gives an answer.

590
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,963
who was the leader of that march?

591
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,299
Who was the guide?

592
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,467
The Amud Ha'Anan (the pillar of cloud)

593
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,304
Amud Ha'Anan was an instrument in the hands of the Almighty.

594
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,774
The guide was the Almighty.

595
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,575
the Torah told us in B’shallach:

596
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,311
"Hashem went in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day,

597
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,913
to lead them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light,

598
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,183
so that they might travel by day and by night.

599
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:18,855
Now the Torah tells us how the camps were arranged marching.

600
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:27,864
Which tribes formed the avant garde and which tribes formed the rear guard:

601
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,434
M’asef lekhol haMachanot.

602
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:38,809
The Torah speaks of Tziv’otam (hosts) of warriors:

603
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,912
Kol Yotz’ei Tzava.

604
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,815
The Torah also relates to us

605
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,517
the story of the two Hatzotzrot in this context

606
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,753
because it’s very important.

607
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,789
The story of the signal system.

608
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,126
Moshe was the commander 

609
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,261
he directed and instructed the

610
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:01,231
various camps, on the march 

611
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,935
to the Promised Land. There was need for communication.

612
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:11,208
And the means of communication were the two silver trumpets, the Hatzotzrot of silver.

613
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,113
And if you read carefully Beha'alotcha,

614
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,582
Beha'alotcha is a long sidra,

615
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,517
the baal korehs rush through the sidra.

616
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:27,324
So you feel the feeling of the psukim,

617
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,264
"And they marched from the mountain of Gd a distance of 3 days.

618
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:38,101
And the Ark of the Covenant traveled in front of them on that three days’ journey 

619
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,038
to seek out a resting place for them."

620
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,574
And "when both are blown..." "if only one is blown..."

621
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,611
"when you blow a T’ruah, the camps on the east side shall set out; 

622
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:51,915
when you blow a second T’ruah, the camps on the south side shall set out.

623
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,785
A T’ruah is to be blown whenever they are to set out."

624
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,553
What do you feel in that?

625
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,855
I mean I felt it.

626
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:12,803
Torah is not only important to explain intellectually in categories,

627
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,872
but also in emotional categories.

628
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,141
You want to understand the beauty

629
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,576
and the greatness of the Torah,

630
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:23,580
the emotional mood which is created by kriyas HaTorah

631
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,949
is perhaps more important than the

632
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,018
than the intellectual gesture.

633
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,887
What do you feel?

634
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:36,993
I feel a mood of expectancy and tension.

635
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:43,500
A mood of expectancy permeates the pages of Beha'alotcha. 

636
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,609
There is, you feel a mood

637
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,213
there is a mood of mobilization

638
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,549
and rigid order

639
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,018
in the air.

640
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,925
All conditions were met,

641
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,733
the reward is about to be granted,

642
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,372
finally finally the promise to Abraham

643
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,876
is about to be fulfilled.

644
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,045
"I will bring..." will become the 5th freedom.

645
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,749
The people are on their final triumphal march.

646
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:42,092
Now in this context, I would rather say in this mood,

647
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,861
Moshe was excited.

648
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,997
It was very hard to excite Moshe.

649
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,732
Moshe was excited.

650
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:53,436
He was expecting great things.

651
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,041
There is tenseness in the air.

652
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:05,382
And there is determination, boldness to break through if neccesary.

653
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,119
Interesting, is the conversation between Moses

654
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,021
and his father in law.

655
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,791
What does it mean?

656
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,194
What kind of a mood on the part of Moshe 

657
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,598
is mirrored, or reflected,

658
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,800
by this conversation.

659
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,137
We get a glimpse into Moses, into his mood.

660
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,507
Those days 

661
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,676
after the second Passover,

662
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,978
when the Pesach was offered,

663
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,447
and the people started to march.

664
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:43,620
"In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month,

665
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,355
the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the covenant.

666
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:48,058
Then the Israelites set out by stages…"

667
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,394
It was not one of many journeys...

668
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,764
It was THE journey! The final journey!

669
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,033
After that journey, 

670
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:01,271
Moshe expected there would be no need to journey anymore, to travel.

671
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,477
What does the conversation

672
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,412
the inner nation the favour of Israel

673
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,983
the favour of whoever the John has the creation nation

674
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:17,187
“We are setting out for the place of which Hashem said, ‘I will give it to you’;

675
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:21,958
come with us, and we will treat you well; for Hashem has promised good to Israel.”

676
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,061
What impression do you get?

677
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,497
What is the emotional climate of that?

678
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:39,909
It is a climate of serenity,

679
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,846
peace of mind

680
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:46,716
an unqualified assurance.

681
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,021
Moses spoke

682
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:55,258
of the final journey to the Promised Land.

683
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,661
no waiting anymore.

684
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,664
No Ani Ma’amin – I believe in the coming of Mashiach,

685
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:04,134
even if he may tarry, I will wait for him…

686
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,137
There would be no need for it anymore.

687
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,939
No delays,

688
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,042
no procrastination,

689
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,978
no if and no when:

690
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,248
Im Shamo’a Tishm’u – If you will listen –

691
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,117
It is now!

692
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,690
It is going to happen now.  Right now!

693
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,460
Not tomorrow.  Right now.

694
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,631
Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law,

695
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,566
“We are setting out”

696
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,536
It is present tense, not “We will set out”

697
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,539
 rather,  “We are setting out”…

698
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,908
for the place of which Hashem said, 

699
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,378
‘I will give it to you’; come with us, and we will treat you well;

700
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,213
for Hashem has promised good to Israel.

701
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,016
All the promises will be fulfilled!

702
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,484
 I won’t have to ask questions

703
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,719
why have you mistreated this people?

704
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,487
Why did you ever send me? Ever since I came to Pharaoh…

705
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,289
No problems, no questions, no doubts.

706
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,858
Nothing.

707
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,861
It will be very simple.

708
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,232
And I want to let you in on another secret.

709
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:13,169
It was not an invitation
extended to the father in law.

710
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,372
It's not an invitation

711
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,975
which a son in law extends to his father in law.

712
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:27,117
It was not an invitation extended by an individual to another human being

713
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,652
to share the good things in life.

714
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,022
It was more than that.

715
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,992
It was an invitation extended to whom?

716
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,562
by Moses, representing Klal Yisrael,

717
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,897
to whom?

718
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,768
To all Gerim.

719
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,437
To all Gerim of all generations.

720
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,408
The Midrash in Kohelet says:

721
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,744
“All of the rivers flow into the sea and the sea is never filled”

722
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,114
these are the Gerim who come to Eretz Yisrael to convert.

723
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,953
It was extended to all Gerim.

724
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,956
to the entire non-Jewish world.

725
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,059
Join us!

726
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,696
To come to join us
in the Promised Land.

727
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,366
Provided, of course, there is one condition.

728
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,102
We have one condition.

729
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,574
According to Halacha.

730
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,011
No ifs and no whens.

731
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,682
To come to join us in the Promised Land,

732
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:39,456
Provided that the non-Jew is ready to subject himself to the same Divine discipline as we did.

733
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:42,892
Any human being

734
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:47,831
was offered the opportunity
to join the march to the Promised Land.

735
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,167
The march to be

736
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,769
 to the Messianic era.

737
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,904
If that march had been realized,

738
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,841
the coming of Mashiach would have taken place when?

739
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,878
Then. Moses would have been the Mashiach.

740
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,380
It was quite optional.

741
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,648
The Jews could have reached it.

742
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,517
They lost it.

743
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:08,451
They lost it,

744
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:12,822
so Moses is not the Mashiach,

745
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:17,760
And the distance in time between them is long

746
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,164
and far.

747
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,541
The Torah was given to us.

748
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,476
Certainly.

749
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,480
Eretz Yisrael was granted to us, certainly.

750
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,317
However,
we were told to pass on Gd’s word

751
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,152
to mankind as such.

752
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,322
We all remember the famous verse

753
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,092
in Shofarot of Rosh HaShana:

754
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:52,262
“All you inhabitants of the world, you who live on the earth,

755
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:56,266
when a signal is raised on the mountains, look!  When a trumpet is blown, listen!”

756
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:01,237
We are all invited – all the dwellers on this world.

757
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:07,176
We are setting out for the place of which Hashem said,

758
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:11,381
‘I will give it to you’; come with us, and we will treat you well…

759
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,250
What does Moshe think?

760
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,287
That Yitro, the non-Jew, is dependent upon us?

761
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,460
Our Torah is commodious enough

762
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,630
to encompass the entire world.

763
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:32,068
There is enough chesed, goodness, and happiness in the Torah,

764
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,505
to be transmitted to others
and to be shared by others.

765
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:38,908
 Join our triumphal march, Moshe said to Yitro,

766
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,878
towards our destiny.

767
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,881
It may become your destiny as well.

768
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,253
And when I read this Parsha,

769
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:54,891
it attracts me.

770
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,795
There is something moving,
touching, in that Parsha.

771
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,664
Sometimes I want to cry

772
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,434
when I read this Parsha.

773
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,736
Something moving, something touching.

774
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,137
I want to cry.

775
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:11,140
I have to control my tears.

776
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,858
what is moving here, is the simplicity,

777
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,829
the way in which the great Moshe

778
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,398
the master of all wise men,

779
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:39,569
and the father of all prophets, speaks.

780
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,970
What do I mean?

781
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:45,742
He uses the grammatical first person:

782
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,011
We are setting out…

783
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:52,015
come with us, and we will treat you well…

784
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:55,718
whatever good Hashem does for us…

785
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,687
What does it mean?

786
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,356
Moshe was certain – 

787
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,493
there was not even a shadow of doubt in his mind – 

788
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:07,797
that he is going to enter the Promised Land.

789
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,602
He and the entire congregation

790
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,071
will be classified as both

791
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:19,442
Yotz’ei Mitzrayim (departers from Egypt) and Ba’ei ha’Aretz (those who come into the Land).

792
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,477
He was sure.

793
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,813
He was convinved.

794
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:31,254
That he would see the beautiful land,

795
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,856
the hills of Judea,

796
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,292
and the prairie land of the Sharon Valley,

797
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,027
he was certain

798
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,497
that we will climb the mount of Levanon.

799
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,766
Later he prayed, but his prayer did not come true:

800
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,702
“…Let me cross over to see the good land 

801
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,270
beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and the Lebanon.”

802
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,572
But that time he felt no need for prayer: 

803
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,007
We are setting out…

804
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:54,110
come with us, and we will treat you well…

805
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:57,113
whatever good Hashem does for us…

806
01:01:57,113 --> 01:02:00,817
There was no doubt about his destiny.

807
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:07,390
The whole operation, if successfully brought to a close 

808
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,093
would have lasted several days.

809
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:14,797
And at that time there was no need for Meraglim, for scouts to explore the land,

810
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:18,401
to see whether the land is good or bad,

811
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,706
or to see whether the cities are surrounded by walls or they are open cities,

812
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,609
what kind of population is there – 

813
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:30,346
strong, weak, a sickly population or a healthy population.

814
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,215
There was no need for it.

815
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:37,653
all those scouts and all the exploration and intelligence work

816
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,389
is only necessary if a man has doubts.

817
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,160
This was the pre-doubt period in Jewish history.

818
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,028
We are setting out for the place of which Hashem said,

819
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:49,132
‘I will give it to you’; come with us, and we will treat you well…

820
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:53,069
Share with us! An open invitation to everybody.

821
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:57,273
Yitro or no Yitro, father-in-law of Moshe or the stranger.

822
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,511
The Torah tells us indeed,

823
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:06,783
And they journeyed from the mount of the Eternal three days journey,

824
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:11,120
and the Ark of the Covenant went before them in the three days journey

825
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,790
to seek out a Menucha (resting place) for them,

826
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:19,061
And they journeyed from the mount of the Eternal three days journey,

827
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:23,399
and the Ark of the Covenant went before them in the three days journey

828
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,737
Where did it go?

829
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:31,841
Where is Menucha for the Jews?

830
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,644
What was the destination?

831
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,846
Rashi, quoting Sifri, says:

832
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,714
A distance of three days journey

833
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,917
they miraculously traveled in one day,

834
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:45,488
because the Almighty wanted to bring them into Eretz Yisrael right away.

835
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,024
A distance of three days journey,

836
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,326
they miraculously traveled in one day,

837
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:53,529
because the Almighty
wanted to bring them into Eretz Yisrael.

838
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,731
Into the land.

839
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,102
So my dear friends, tell me

840
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,470
at that time

841
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,773
before the great reversal took place,

842
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:11,547
was the Parsha of Vay’hi bin’soa’ ha’aron in its proper place or out of context?

843
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,952
Before the Jews alienated God,

844
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,621
before they fell from Him.

845
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:23,059
and they needed Meraglim as scouts and they had doubts.

846
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,329
Before, every Jew was convinced: 

847
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:31,434
This is the final consummation of all hope. 

848
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,904
It was beautiful, the Torah tells us:

849
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,541
And they journeyed from the mount of the Eternal three days journey,

850
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,076
and the Ark of the Covenant went before them in the three days journey 

851
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,844
to seek out a Menucha

852
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,713
the cloud of Hashem being over them by day when they set out from the camp.

853
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,748
(meaning security on all sides)

854
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:49,785
Vay’hi Binsoa’ ha’aron – Whenever the ark set out (leading them right into Eretz Yisrael)

855
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,687
Moses would say,

856
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,724
“Arise, Hashem, let your enemies be scattered, and your foes flee before you.”

857
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,260
Who were the enemies?

858
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,761
As a matter of fact,

859
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,899
The last war they fought was the war against Amalek.

860
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,102
The next war was against Sichon and Og,

861
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,870
40 years later. 

862
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:13,743
Why was Moshe speaking about enemies and fiends and people who threatened them?

863
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,479
Who did Moshe have in mind? 

864
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,984
We are traveling fast to Eretz Yisrael –

865
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,987
there we will be confronted by somebody.

866
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,992
If the great hope had been realized,

867
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:33,896
there would have been no need to engage in battle for seven years.

868
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,600
Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say,

869
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,270
Arise, Hashem, let your enemies be scattered, and your foes flee before you.” 

870
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,505
And whenever it came to rest, he would say,

871
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,041
Return, Hashem of the ten thousand thousands of Israel.”

872
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,044
It was not misplaced.

873
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,045
It was right.

874
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:54,283
It was the continuation of the great story of the final, 

875
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,253
triumphal Messianic march into Eretz Yisrael,

876
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:03,326
which was supposed to take place approximately 3500 years ago.

877
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:17,573
It was certainly in its place 

878
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,209
and there was no need for an inverted Nun 

879
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:24,146
at the beginning and for an inverted Nun at the end.

880
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,248
It was actually 

881
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:30,086
it would have been the climax, or the appex of the whole story.

882
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,158
Had this come true,

883
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:39,595
nothing had happened,

884
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:41,897
The whole Jewish history

885
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:44,967
would have taken a different turn.

886
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,502
According to our tradition,

887
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,571
(Chazal said it many times) 

888
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,840
had Moshe entered Eretz Yisrael,

889
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:55,611
the latter never would have been taken from us – 

890
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:56,979
Why?

891
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:03,452
Because Moses would have been crowned as the Melekh haMashiach.

892
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,922
The Messianic era would have commenced

893
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:12,128
with the conquest of the land by Moses.

894
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,530
Moshe believed

895
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,098
with a great passion

896
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,133
and love

897
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,569
that the final march of redemption had begun – 

898
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,139
it was only a question of days.

899
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:26,142
Suddenly, something happened.

900
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,311
Something happened.

901
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,381
Neither Moshe

902
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,950
nor the Almighty,

903
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,854
nor anybody else,

904
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:46,896
expected the event to transpire.

905
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,832
I asked you before.  What happened, actually?

906
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,500
By the Egel, you know what happened.

907
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,302
About the Meraglim (spies) we know what happened.

908
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:57,339
About Pe’or in Midian, 40 years later,

909
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,642
we know what happened.

910
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,578
What happened here?

911
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,612
What happened?

912
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,581
Nothing in particular.

913
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:09,418
If you want you can dismiss it.

914
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:19,428
“And the multitude that was among them felt a lust.”

915
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,831
That's all.  They had a desire.

916
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:26,268
And the children of Israel also wept again, and they said,

917
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,271
who shall give us flesh to eat?

918
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,245
And the Torah tells us,

919
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:41,016
that this seizure by a desire,

920
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,119
or a lust,

921
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,154
was evil.

922
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,023
It aroused the wrath of the Almighty

923
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:50,993
and also Moshe resented it.

924
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,929
In Moshe’s eyes it was evil –

925
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:55,831
Uv’einei Moshe ra 

926
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,267
First time in Jewish history.

927
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:02,037
Moshe was not the defense attorney:

928
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,706
It is evil.

929
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:07,776
This interrupted the great march. 

930
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,779
It has brought the march to an end.

931
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,315
The vision of Mashiach,

932
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,718
of Eretz Yisrael,

933
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:16,919
of the redemption of Yisrael, 

934
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:19,255
became a distant one,

935
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:22,258
like a distant star,

936
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,326
on a mysterious horizon.

937
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,327
It twinkled.

938
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:31,000
But the road suddenly became almost endless.

939
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,705
Why?

940
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:43,612
Why did Moshe feel discouraged?

941
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:44,914
Why didn’t he offer

942
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:52,254
prayers for the people as was his practice in past situations?

943
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,927
What happened?

944
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,095
Because the incident

945
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:04,867
of Kivrot haTa’avah differed greatly from that of the Egel.

946
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,804
The making of the Egel was the result

947
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,807
of great primitive fright.

948
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:16,845
The people thought that Moses was dead,
they were afraid of the desert.

949
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:20,049
They did not know what the future held
in store for them.

950
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,285
They were simply overwhelmed

951
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:27,323
by a feeling of loneliness and terror.

952
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:31,961
Consequently, they violated the precept of Avodah Zarah.

953
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,598
There were mitigating circumstances.

954
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:40,169
They wanted the Golden Calf to substitute for Moses.

955
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:43,272
as all the Rishonim (medieval commentators) say.

956
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,876
However, when you speak about Avodah Zarah,

957
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,479
you have to distinguish between two things.

958
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,516
Between Avodah Zarah, idolatry,

959
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:59,321
simply as a ritual, as a worship, 

960
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:05,094
and between a pagan way of life.

961
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,363
As a matter of fact,

962
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,797
in Chazal’s opinion,

963
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:12,868
an Avodah Zarah worshipper will also adopt the pagan way of life.

964
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:16,372
But, we know,

965
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,942
 in this day and age,

966
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,945
we know that it's possible

967
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:26,315
for people to live like pagans,

968
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:29,518
even though no idolatry is involved.

969
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,556
Paganism is not the worship of an idol.

970
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,326
It encompasses more than the worship
of an idol.

971
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,662
A certain style of life.

972
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,463
A way of life.

973
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:50,172
What is the pagan way of life

974
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:54,109
in contradistinction to the Torah way of life?

975
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:59,581
The pagan cries for variety.

976
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,085
For boundlessness.

977
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,953
For unlimited lust.

978
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:07,956
And insatiable desire.

979
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,627
The demonic dream of total conquest.

980
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:15,397
Of drinking the cup of pleasure to its dregs.

981
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:25,474
The pagan way of life is the very antithesis of Yahadus.

982
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,477
The latter demands limitedness

983
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:33,615
of enjoyment and the ability to step backwards if necessary,

984
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,585
the ability to withdraw – to retreat.

985
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:44,126
The unlimited desire, which the Greeks call hedone,

986
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,764
is the worst form

987
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,335
is actually the worst desire

988
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,504
in Man.

989
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,442
When Man reaches out for the unreachable,

990
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:05,013
When Man reaches out for the orgiastic and hypnotic,

991
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:16,191
then they don’t violate the prohibition of Avodah Zarah, 

992
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,660
but they adopt the pagan a way of life.

993
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:23,766
And the Torah hated the pagan way of life more than it hated the idol.

994
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,735
Because an idol cannot exist
for a long time.

995
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,170
It cannot last.

996
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,641
Finally, an intelligent person realizes that it is just wood and metal;

997
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,109
It has no life.

998
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:37,446
Avodah Zarah per se is short-lived.

999
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,481
However, a pagan way of life,

1000
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:42,451
has a tremendous attraction for people. 

1001
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,120
The Torah

1002
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,023
describes so beautifully the way

1003
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:51,994
in which the pagan gathers,

1004
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,797
accumulates property –

1005
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,933
gathers the Slav, the quail.

1006
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,870
How he gathers property,

1007
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,807
means of gratification

1008
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,810
of his hungry senses.

1009
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,546
“So the people worked all that day and night”

1010
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,481
That’s how the Torah describes it.

1011
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:16,585
“And all the next day, gathering the quails;

1012
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,121
The least anyone gathered was ten homers;

1013
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,624
And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.”

1014
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,227
They were mad with desire,

1015
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:30,499
There was no controlling, limiting element in their desire for vastness.

1016
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:37,873
The imagination actually excited them.

1017
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:46,648
And their good sense was surrounded with a nimbus which was irresistible.

1018
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,817
The more, the better.

1019
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,122
And you start gathering new goods even before

1020
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:58,393
you have completed gathering the other goods.

1021
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:02,130
The pagan is impatient and insatiable.

1022
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:05,400
That ‘s what the Torah describes in Kivrot haTa’avah.

1023
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,871
There’s another story in the Torah which,

1024
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:18,847
in contradistinction to the unlimited desire of the pagan,

1025
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,251
the Torah describes the Jewish way of life.

1026
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,385
It's interesting,

1027
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:24,987
it's the Manna.

1028
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,257
And Moses said to them:

1029
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:31,126
This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat,

1030
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:34,696
gather as much of it as each of you

1031
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,866
 is required to eat.

1032
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:42,371
An omer to a person, for as many of you as there are.

1033
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,740
But when they measured it,

1034
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,141
by the omer, 

1035
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:49,945
he who gathered much had no excess,

1036
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:53,248
 and he who gathered little had no deficiency.

1037
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:57,019
This is the approach of Yahadus.

1038
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,624
The great tragedy happened,

1039
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:06,562
 the triumphal final march suddenly came to a stop.

1040
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,765
A people who rejected the basic principle

1041
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,433
of economic

1042
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:20,809
limitedness and aesthetic enjoyment,

1043
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:26,448
these people were not worthy to enter the Land.

1044
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,084
Suddenly., what happened?

1045
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,820
The Parsha of Vay’hi binsoa’ ha’aron

1046
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:35,457
found itself displaced, dislocated.

1047
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:45,133
The march

1048
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,369
to that land,

1049
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:50,238
I mean, the distance to that land,

1050
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,241
suddenly became very long.

1051
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,747
Of course, there was no edict yet concerning the 40 years.

1052
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:01,550
The time the people would have to spend in the desert.

1053
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,519
But Moses felt intuitively

1054
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,255
that the great march had come to an end.

1055
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:11,860
Hopes he had will be unfulfilled.

1056
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,497
And visions he had will not be realized.

1057
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,566
And his prayers will be rejected.

1058
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,600
He knew that.

1059
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,569
I tell you frankly, I don’t have to say 

1060
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,638
Moses was the master of the prophets,

1061
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,239
he knew Gd didn’t reveal it to him.

1062
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,508
 I remember from my own experience,

1063
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:30,145
during the illness of my wife.

1064
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,081
She was sick for four years.

1065
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,383
And of course, 

1066
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,318
I am a realist.

1067
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,321
And it is very hard to fool me.

1068
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,556
Not even doctors can fool me.

1069
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,426
But, somehow I was convinced

1070
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,895
that somehow she would manage to get out of it.

1071
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,098
And I lived with hope

1072
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:52,634
 and tremendous unlimited faith.

1073
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,904
 I remember, it was the last Yom Kippur before she died.

1074
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,372
 And it was Kol Nidrei

1075
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,408
and I was holding a Sefer Torah for Kol Nidrei

1076
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,977
and when the Chazan finished Kol Nidrei and said

1077
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,645
Shehech’yanu veqiy’manu vehigi’anu laz’man hazeh

1078
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,816
 I turned over the Sefer Torah to a Talmid of mine.

1079
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,520
And I told him to put it in the Aron Kodesh.

1080
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,221
He put it in the Aron Kodesh,

1081
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,557
apparently he didn’t place it well, I don’t know what,

1082
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:17,659
but the Sefer Torah slipped

1083
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,094
and fell.

1084
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,930
Not on the floor, but in the Aron Kodesh.

1085
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:27,402
At that time I was filled –

1086
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,940
don’t ask me how or why –

1087
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,643
I felt a gefil –

1088
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,747
Nothing will help.

1089
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:40,749
And indeed it was.

1090
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:48,890
When the Am haMit’avim (the people who had the craving)

1091
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,029
began to complain and to weep, 

1092
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,165
Moses knew, this is the end.

1093
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,433
He’ll never see Eretz Yisrael.

1094
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,235
Never.

1095
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,572
That’s why he said:

1096
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,173
If this is the way you are going to treat me,

1097
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:06,608
put me to death at once…

1098
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,411
and do not let me see my misery.

1099
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,414
And how beautifully the Chazal said:

1100
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:15,650
“Eldad and Meidad were having prophecy in the camp” 

1101
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,221
What did they say?

1102
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,556
What was the excitement about?

1103
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,259
They said just one short sentence:

1104
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,428
Moshe‘s hopes,

1105
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,397
“We are setting out…

1106
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:34,669
come with us, and we will treat you well…” 

1107
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:36,671
Will never come true.

1108
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,073
Moshe will die.

1109
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,342
He’ll be buried in the sand dunes in the desert – 

1110
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,378
he’ll never see the beautiful land and the Levanon – 

1111
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:46,882
Moshe meit viY’hoshua makhnis.

1112
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:50,218
Moshe will die and Yehoshua will lead [the people] in to the Land.

1113
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:54,222
And then the parashas Vay’hi binsoa’ ha’aron

1114
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,493
Suddenly lost its place.

1115
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:01,496
It was dislocated and displaced.

1116
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,133
Do you know why it was dislocated and displaced?

1117
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:08,170
Because two little Nuns were inverted –

1118
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,039
The march was inverted.

1119
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,942
Instead of the march bringing them closer to Eretz Yisrael,

1120
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,546
the march took them away from Eretz Yisrael.

1121
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:18,980
Binsoa’ ha’aron

1122
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,715
the Nun was inverted.

1123
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,652
and with the inversion of the Nun,

1124
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,287
 Jewish history became inverted.

1125
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:27,923
and it is still inverted.

1126
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,892
The Parsha is still “dislocated”.

1127
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,395
We cannot say “we are setting forth”

1128
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,197
with the assurance and certitude

1129
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,432
with which Moshe said it to Yitro his father-in-law

1130
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:40,168
just 24 hours before the Mit’avim

1131
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,371
inverted the Jewish process of redemption.

1132
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,180
Finally, is now the continuation of the Parsha –

1133
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,650
I didn’t yet explain the problem of Miriam,

1134
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,053
which I will now explain.

1135
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:02,157
The Torah describes the construction of the Mikdash,

1136
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,993
the Torah describes the Exodus,

1137
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,595
Matan Torah in Parashat Yitro,

1138
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,363
the construction of the Mikdash in Parashat Teruma.

1139
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,967
Suddenly, something happened which interrupted the continuity –

1140
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,401
the Egel.

1141
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:16,204
The construction was delayed for a certain number of days.

1142
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,073
Finally the Beis Hamikdash was ready.

1143
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,876
Sefer Vayyikra (Leviticus) is devoted completely

1144
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,479
to the worship, to “you shall worship God on this mountain.”

1145
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:28,617
Then in Bamidbar (Numbers) the Torah still tells us

1146
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:32,354
about the last act of dedication by the Nesi’im (princes).

1147
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,723
And the lighting of the candles.

1148
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,591
And the sanctification of the Levi’im.

1149
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:39,060
So “you shall worship Gd on this mountain” was attained,

1150
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,062
the two objectives were reached,

1151
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,230
now the march began.

1152
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,432
The Torah tells us how the Jews were marching

1153
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:49,571
on the final triumphal march on the final triumphal journey to Eretz Yisrael.

1154
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,039
The pillar of cloud covered them,

1155
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:52,874
protected them, shielded them.

1156
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:58,013
 It was in front and was also the rear guard protecting them in back.

1157
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:01,216
And then how Moshe communicated with the camps,

1158
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,717
the Chatzotzrot of silver,

1159
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:07,555
and Moshe’s conversation with Yitro.

1160
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,891
He already had Eretz Yisrael within his reach,

1161
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,294
he extended the generous invitation to mankind,

1162
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:14,362
to share in our Ge’ulah – our redemption,

1163
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,997
and everything was ready.

1164
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,533
Vay’hi Bin’soa’ ha’aron –

1165
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:21,202
They had to take just a few more days.

1166
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,804
During the last few days, something happened –

1167
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:24,372
disaster struck.

1168
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:29,678
And that disaster has inverted Jewish History,

1169
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:33,448
and that disaster dislocated the Parshat Vay’hi Bin’soa’ ha’aron.

1170
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:39,120
And that disaster inverted the march –

1171
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,222
instead of marching to Eretz Yisrael,

1172
01:22:41,222 --> 01:22:44,426
we began to march away from Eretz Yisrael.

1173
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,863
Moshe discovered something else –

1174
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,333
Moses realized something else.

1175
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,903
He knew pretty well

1176
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:58,239
that he was chosen as the teacher of Klal Yisrael.

1177
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,276
Gd did not elect him as a diplomat,

1178
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:02,177
as a negotiator,

1179
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,647
but as the teacher, or the rebbe of the people.

1180
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,350
As their spiritual and moral leader.

1181
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,052
Gd Himself told him, when Moshe asked:

1182
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,287
“Who am I, that I should go to Phar’aoh?”

1183
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:15,190
He said: “you shall worship God on this mountain”.

1184
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,660
Basically, Moshe, had I been looking for a negotiator,

1185
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,962
I wouldn’t have selected you.

1186
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:22,430
But I'm not looking for a negotiator.

1187
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,433
 I can do the work of negotiating by myself.

1188
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,303
I need a teacher for my people.

1189
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,373
As a teacher, you yourself will agree
that you are the best one.

1190
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:32,874
You are a teacher par excellence.

1191
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,376
And that’s why I selected you:

1192
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,543
‘And it shall be your sign’ – 

1193
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,579
and that is the reason (the Chinuch writes that).

1194
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:42,117
That I selected you and not somebody else.

1195
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:49,157
There were many people in Egypt who were qualified to be negotiators;

1196
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,994
because the purpose of the Exodus is not political freedom,

1197
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:58,366
but the conversion of a slave society into a Kingdom of Kohanim and a holy nation.

1198
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,335
And for that you are wonderful. 

1199
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,905
Moshe knew this.

1200
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,943
However,

1201
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,384
he did not expect, until the Mit’avim,

1202
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,655
that he would assume the role not only of a teacher,

1203
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:24,025
that he was ready to do since the Exodus.

1204
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:27,695
But of whom?

1205
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:33,101
Of a nursing mother or father – an Omein.

1206
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,236
What is an Omein?

1207
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:36,471
Omein is not a Rav.

1208
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:41,409
Omein is a nursing father or mother.

1209
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:47,615
Of course, a nursing mother teaches the baby.

1210
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:51,453
Perhaps the mother is the best and most important teacher

1211
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,855
in the life of a baby.

1212
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:57,492
But she does something else –

1213
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,360
namely,

1214
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,796
the rebbe teaches the talmidim.

1215
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:05,200
The Omein, the nursing mother,

1216
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,035
in addition to teaching,

1217
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:08,603
does something else.

1218
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:13,007
She carries the baby in her bosom or in her arms.

1219
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,412
 “…as a nurse carries a sucking child.”

1220
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:20,315
What does it mean that he carries the baby

1221
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:22,584
in his bosom and in his arms,

1222
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,819
or in her bosom and in her arms.

1223
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:28,957
Usually the father doesn’t do it, the mother does it.

1224
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,525
The father has no patience for that.

1225
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,827
The mother does it.

1226
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:34,696
What does it mean she carries it?

1227
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,732
Actually it is true literally.

1228
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:43,671
 But it has more meaning 

1229
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,575
than the word literally contains.

1230
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,611
What does it mean?

1231
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:54,182
The teacher does teach his disciple,

1232
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,484
but the disciple does not become a part of him.

1233
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,886
Very seldom.

1234
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:01,656
When the mother teaches the baby,

1235
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,325
the baby becomes a part of her.

1236
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:09,264
The mother, when she rears the baby,

1237
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,833
or when she nurses the baby,

1238
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,868
has one calling,

1239
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:15,236
one purpose.

1240
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,172
To protect the baby.

1241
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,207
The Omein or the mother

1242
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:24,045
basically do not belong to themselves.

1243
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:28,983
Many may be very critical of my statement

1244
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,319
but this is true according to Yahadus.

1245
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,588
The mother has no life of her own.

1246
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,490
She belongs to the infant.

1247
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:40,094
At least as long as the infant is small, helpless

1248
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:43,231
and exposed to danger, to the environment.

1249
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:46,034
To a hostile environment.

1250
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,236
She belongs to the infant.

1251
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,505
Moshe discovered now

1252
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,575
that teaching is not enough for a leader of Yisrael.

1253
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,543
It's not enough.

1254
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:59,514
The teacher, no matter how devoted,
has a life of his own

1255
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:03,084
That his job is nursing,

1256
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:06,087
carrying the baby in his arms,

1257
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,524
watching every step

1258
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,459
guessing the baby’s needs. 

1259
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,195
A baby cannot say what she wants, you have to guess.

1260
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,530
Feeling

1261
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:20,468
Feeling pain

1262
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,136
when the baby cries.

1263
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:25,907
And being happy when the baby is cheerful.

1264
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:29,811
Teaching or instructing her good performances,

1265
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,813
but that is not everything.

1266
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:37,652
Moses, who reconciled with his role as a teacher and leader of adults,

1267
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,055
began to doubt his ability

1268
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:46,461
to play the role of an Omen or mother nurse.

1269
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,430
Listen to his words:

1270
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:52,700
Did I conceive all these people,

1271
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:56,638
 did I bear them, that you say to me: Carry them in your bosom

1272
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:59,841
as a nurse carries an infant? 

1273
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,044
Moses knew,

1274
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,412
he discovered,

1275
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:07,348
something very tragic in a mother’s life.

1276
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:09,417
What did he discover?

1277
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,420
He knew that from now on

1278
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,491
he is an individual

1279
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:18,993
he has no rights at all.

1280
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:23,398
He as an individual, has no rights at all.

1281
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,736
He has no rights.

1282
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,272
He has no right to rejoice,

1283
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:34,275
whenever Gd will be good to him.

1284
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,045
As a private person,

1285
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:41,482
he is not entitled to enjoy life as an individual,

1286
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:46,087
to be happy in an ordinary way
like any other human being.

1287
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:49,657
Because his children

1288
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:53,261
will never belong to Moshe.

1289
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,231
He lost his family.

1290
01:28:57,231 --> 01:29:01,102
He became the mother
or the nurse of the Klal Yisrael.

1291
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:04,072
No family of his own.

1292
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,974
And that's what Chazal say.

1293
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:10,945
He separated himself from his wife.

1294
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:13,614
 It isn’t just his wife from whom he separated.

1295
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:17,752
It’s the wife and children (two lovely boys).

1296
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:19,020
He had a sister,

1297
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,588
he had a brother.

1298
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:23,524
He knew he could not share his joy with them.

1299
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,527
They cannot share their joy with him.

1300
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:33,434
He is the father of Klal Yisrael.

1301
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:37,905
And that is what he says.

1302
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:42,643
The role of “as a nurse carries a sucking child”

1303
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:47,081
was imposed upon him during the rebellion of the Mit’onenim.

1304
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:49,016
He separated himself,

1305
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:51,652
he withdrew not only from his mate, Tzipora,

1306
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,755
but also from his children.

1307
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,124
Tell me, where are Moshe’s children?

1308
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:58,860
Did you ever come across Moshe’s children?

1309
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,228
Ever?

1310
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,397
There was a census taken in the Midbar,

1311
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,599
at the beginning of the 40 years

1312
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:06,467
and at the end of the 40 years.

1313
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:10,171
Are Moshe’s children mentioned?

1314
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:11,906
Not once.

1315
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,841
This is the lineage of Moses and Aaron...

1316
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:15,243
These are the names of the sons of Aaron:

1317
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,078
Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar;

1318
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,679
Where are Moshe’s children?

1319
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,782
Moshe did not have children.

1320
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:23,751
And it is later, in Tanach,

1321
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:27,021
The Bible,

1322
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:29,857
the name of Moses’ child

1323
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:31,559
was mentioned,

1324
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:35,129
not as the son of Moshe, but the son of “Menasheh”.

1325
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:39,033
A little Nun was added to the word.  Why?

1326
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:45,273
Not only in order to reflect unfavorably upon Moshe

1327
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,475
this is ridiculous.

1328
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,710
Moses was not responsible for what happened

1329
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:53,014
because Moshe did not have children.

1330
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:56,050
I always say

1331
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,020
if Moses had a child,

1332
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,456
then according to the law he would have been in a most awful dilemma.

1333
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,192
According to the law, it would have been required of him

1334
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:07,462
to give preference to his child, 

1335
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,697
as far as the study of Torah is concerned,

1336
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:13,267
over the child of his next-door neighbor.

1337
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:16,037
This is a law which Moshe Rabbenu taught us:

1338
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:19,307
Your own son takes precedence (in teaching Torah) over the son of your fellow.

1339
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,174
On the other hand,

1340
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:22,910
Moshe had no right to give any preference,

1341
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:26,247
or to give an additional second to his son,

1342
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:32,720
because he was the father of every child within the Jewish community.

1343
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:34,989
So Moshe lost his children.

1344
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,658
He became the Omein, the nursing mother,

1345
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:40,661
of K’lal Yisrael.

1346
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:47,301
And that is exactly what Gd told him

1347
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:49,370
at the time of Matan Torah:

1348
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,706
You say to them,

1349
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,975
return to your tents, to your private lives, 

1350
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,511
but you, stay here.

1351
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,647
You say to them, return to your tents,

1352
01:31:59,881 --> 01:32:01,949
 to your private lives,

1353
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:04,952
but you, stay here.

1354
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:06,320
Moshe realized it

1355
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,323
during the incident of the Mit’onenim.

1356
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,393
And that is what Miriam,

1357
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:15,396
 the true, loyal sister, resented.

1358
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:18,633
Does prophecy require of Man

1359
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:21,636
alienation of his family?

1360
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:24,705
Does Gd require of the prophet

1361
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:26,274
that he should forget his sister and brother,

1362
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:27,742
his children and wife,

1363
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:30,244
and dedicate himself only to the people?

1364
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,681
…Has He not spoken through us also?

1365
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:37,218
And we live a beautiful life

1366
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:40,221
with our husbands and children and relatives.

1367
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:43,891
And it doesn’t interfere with our devotion to the people.

1368
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,229
That’s exactly what Gd resented and told her:

1369
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:51,098
There is a difference between you and Moses.

1370
01:32:51,098 --> 01:32:52,633
Yes, 

1371
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:57,972
An ordinary prophet does not have to sacrifice his private interest,

1372
01:32:57,972 --> 01:32:59,607
his selfish concerns,

1373
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,276
his family, his father, mother children,

1374
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:03,244
brother, sister;

1375
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:04,879
He can be a prophet

1376
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:06,547
and communicate with Gd,

1377
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,015
and at the same time be a devoted father,

1378
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:11,152
a loving brother,

1379
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,555
and a helpful head of the family.

1380
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:17,558
“Not so my servant Moshe.”

1381
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:21,062
He’s consecrated fully and wholly to me.

1382
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:24,098
And that's

1383
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,101
how the Parsha of B’haalot’kha 

1384
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:31,305
concludes its long story –

1385
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:33,274
it’s one story, this story – 

1386
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,209
of a great march

1387
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:37,945
which could have led us 

1388
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:41,282
into the Messianic era.

1389
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,718
On that day, God will be one 
and His Name one.

1390
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:45,653
But which was interrupted

1391
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:49,056
by some multitude which was permissive,

1392
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:52,059
hedone seekers.
