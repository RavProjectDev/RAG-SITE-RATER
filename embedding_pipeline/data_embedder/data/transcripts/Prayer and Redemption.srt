1
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:16,383
Rabbi Soloveitchik,
worthy Rabbis, friends.

2
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:20,754
First, my thanks to Al [inaudible] and
to Bernie Steinberg, who made this rather

3
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,758
glorious capping of a very active and
fruitful year of programming possible.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,500
A wise man once said, "Let a teacher
beware, for he knows not how far his

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,140
influence extends." And there are
some teachers, the lucky few, who

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,812
occasionally touch a life here or touch
a life there, and those whose lives have

7
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,414
been touched may influence yet others.

8
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,085
But all of us here know, students
and teachers alike, that there

9
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,688
really aren't many of these who
have even that kind of privilege.

10
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,462
But tonight, we have as our speaker a
man who's recognized as the spiritual

11
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:07,534
and intellectual mentor of the majority
of Orthodox rabbis serving in this

12
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,305
country today, who has touched directly
and indirectly the lives of thousands,

13
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:17,577
kindled in many a heart what the
poet calls the inextinguishable fire.

14
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:23,316
And he does so not simply because of
his position at Yeshiva University,

15
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:28,655
Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological
Seminary, he does it not because of

16
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,692
any kind of official position, but
because of the quality of the man.

17
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:37,897
And Holmes put it beautifully once when
he said, "If a man is great, he makes

18
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,202
others believe in greatness; he makes
them incapable of mean ideals and easy

19
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,974
self-satisfaction." It's "The ferment
of genius in its creative moment," which

20
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:52,912
inspires others and gives rise again to
borrow from Holmes, "The enthusiasm of the

21
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,950
lecture-room, the contagious interest of
companionship," these things which "make

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,788
the students partners in their teacher's
work," in the finest sense of that word.

23
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,525
And who is this man, Rabbi
Joseph Ber Soloveitchik?

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,028
Scion of Brisk, that famous

25
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:15,301
family, who, in 1930, was awarded the
PhD in philosophy at the University of

26
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:20,173
Berlin, and a recognized authority in
secular philosophy, himself a master

27
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,844
of Talmudic scholarship, and one
who's able to blend the wisdom of the

28
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,113
one with the insights of the other.

29
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:32,051
This teacher, who cannot be measured
simply by the students in his classroom

30
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:37,690
in the conventional sense, or even by
those, the many, a surprising number, who

31
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:42,295
each year choose to brave a Massachusetts
summer to be with him in intensive study

32
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:47,467
for the full period, but not even this
suffices to give even a glimmering.

33
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,570
His famous lectures, the yahrzeit shiurs,

34
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,742
the pre-holiday lectures, when mature
scholars, rabbis, and pulpits from

35
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,979
miles and miles around, informed
baalei batim flock and crowd the halls

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,215
to listen and thereafter to discuss.

37
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:08,755
And throughout all this period, in
addition, he has served as Chief Rabbi of

38
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:15,295
Boston, creator of institutions, leader
of his flock and yet, when offered the

39
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,200
post of Chief Rabbi of Israel some years
ago, he made the choice that he preferred

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,707
to spend his time primarily in the halls
of learning, saying shiurim, touching

41
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:33,179
the lives of others, I would say, in
his role as teacher of a generation.

42
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:39,419
And today, I say no more, for in
a very literal sense, I think our

43
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,156
tradition demands that someone far
greater in stature than I could ever

44
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:47,794
aspire to be would be required even
to attempt assessment, but I think it

45
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,996
is permissible to mention the topic.

46
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:54,367
And his topic today, the very
formulation of it, he speaks a

47
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,469
variety of disciplines and of culture.

48
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,708
He speaks on prayer and
redemption and halachic equate.

49
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:07,113
We are privileged tonight to hear
the Rav, as he is affectionately

50
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,382
known, Rabbi Joseph Ber Soloveitchik.

51
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,917
Rabbi Soloveitchik.

52
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,594
Thank you very much, Doctor
Leo Levin, for your kind words.

53
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:25,331
[Inaudible]

54
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,969
Let me reintroduce myself.

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:41,914
I am not a philosopher, and
certainly not a theologian.

56
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,150
I am a teacher,

57
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,220
and I like teaching.

58
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,359
For me, teaching is not just a
profession but an experience.

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,862
My field is halachah.

60
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,531
I'm a teacher of Talmud,
and my field is halachah.

61
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,167
I've always believed

62
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:11,644
that the halachah embraces a double
order, an objective, abstract order.

63
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,547
The halachah is very abstract.

64
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:20,186
Basically, to study halachah
means to learn how to

65
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,589
construct [inaudible ]

66
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,294
So, there cannot be any
question of improvisation

67
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,197
[inaudible]

68
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:36,636
True, we are just concerned
with correspondence.

69
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:42,375
The experience corresponds
to a certain halachic act.

70
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:49,849
I'll try tonight, with your permission,
to explore the experiential order

71
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,954
within the halachah of prayer.

72
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:02,395
What I'm going to say 
will not be philosophy.

73
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,497
As I said, I'm not a philosopher.

74
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,434
I would not engage in
the philosophical jargon.

75
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:17,143
Take my words right now as a
confession rather than a discourse.

76
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,112
I'll confide in you.

77
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,583
I'll tell you the story
of my prayer experience.

78
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:30,423
If you should say that my feelings
are sensible -- that's all what

79
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,192
I ask for -- I'll feel proud.

80
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,634
However, if you should dismiss them
as neurotic, I won't feel offended.

81
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:49,242
There's an old, old doctrine,
which is attributed to Plato, to

82
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,043
Kierkegaard, but actually Maimonides

83
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:58,050
said it in a more beautiful way:
the religious experience is madness.

84
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:03,456
Since I consider myself a
religious person, so I'm mad.

85
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,592
So if you'll dismiss them 
as being neurotic,

86
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,295
I will not feel offended or insulted.

87
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,202
Now, with your permission, I'll start.

88
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,771
Redemption,

89
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:24,143
geulah, is a fundamental category in

90
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,845
Judaic thinking.

91
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,881
Our history, as a matter of fact,

92
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,985
was initiated by a
divine act of redemption.

93
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,955
We just celebrated the
holiday of Passover.

94
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,356
It's a holiday of redemption.

95
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:43,596
And our history will also be consummated

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,836
with a divine act of final, ultimate
redemption, the so-called 

97
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:54,574
geulah atidah, the 
messianic redemption.

98
00:07:55,575 --> 00:08:03,115
The halachah, in a very strange,
almost enigmatic manner, has

99
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,052
identified redemption with prayer.

100
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,455
To pray means to redeem oneself.

101
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,093
To redeem oneself means to pray,
because an equation can be reversed.

102
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:21,334
And that equation of redemption
and prayer was, so to say,

103
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:28,975
subsumed under the famous halachah – I
mean, I don't know you, gentlemen,

104
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:34,647
but many among you probably know
the term semichas geulah l'tefillah.

105
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,817
It means geulah and 
tefillah are identical.

106
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:43,422
And it is our custom that in the
morning, we say Go'al Yisrael, the

107
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:47,527
Redeemer of Israel, and then we start
the Shemoneh Esrei, which is the

108
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,262
tefillah, the prayer, immediately.

109
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,063
We don't even answer amen.

110
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,467
There is no Kaddish. It's a continuation.

111
00:08:54,867 --> 00:09:00,339
The Birkat Geulah, I mean, the
benediction of geulah, is continued by

112
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,808
the first benediction in Shemoneh Esrei.

113
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,844
That's exactly what I'm going to explore.

114
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,648
What is redemption?

115
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:14,453
And I wish to remark, I'll
employ the so-called Spinoza or

116
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,225
Descartes method, more geometrico.

117
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,529
I'll try to somehow apply a
mathematical approach to what I'm

118
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,098
going to say, in the sense that

119
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:31,404
I'll postulate a few premises.

120
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,941
That means it's more of a 
deductive approach

121
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,779
to the problem of prayer 
and redemption.

122
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,182
Redemption portrays

123
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:53,426
a shift from the periphery to the
center of history, or, employing the

124
00:09:53,426 --> 00:10:02,602
physical term, we may say redemption
can be described as the centripetal

125
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,839
movement from the 
periphery toward the center.

126
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,509
Let me explain it.

127
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:18,985
Being on the periphery, actually,
means being a non-history-making

128
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,554
collective or group.

129
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,623
There are many groups which

130
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,561
are on the periphery, have
never moved toward the center.

131
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,163
Not only groups, even nations.

132
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,834
Being on the periphery means

133
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,072
to be a non-history-making collective.

134
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:47,213
While the movement toward the center
changes the same collective into a

135
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:53,486
history-making, history-involved,
and history-conscious, not a

136
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,322
collective anymore, but a people.

137
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:06,832
A history-making people leads -- it's
very hard on me to use the next

138
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,070
term -- a speaking, storytelling,

139
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,976
kerygmatic existence, an
existence with a message, kerygma.

140
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:23,249
While a non-history-making,
non-history-involved, and

141
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,519
non-history-conscious people
-- group, rather, I shouldn't say

142
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,393
people -- group is a non-communing,
a non-communicative, a silent entity.

143
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:43,969
History-making existence and a speaking
existence are identical concepts.

144
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:49,041
Now, the answer to the question which I

145
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:54,480
raised before, what is
redemption, is obvious.

146
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,486
Redemption is identical with 
the revelation of the word.

147
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:09,061
When the word is revealed to a people,
the people is redeemed; or, it is

148
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,566
identical with the burgeoning of speech.

149
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:24,844
When a people leaves a mute world
and enters a world of sound,

150
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:31,550
a world of speech, a world of
song, the process of geulah,

151
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,688
of redemption, commences.

152
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:43,696
In other words, a mute life,
a silent life, is identical

153
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,532
with bondage, with slavery.

154
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:56,675
A speech-endowed life, a kerygmatic and
a communicative life, is a free life.

155
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:08,053
A slave lives in silence,
if he does live at all.

156
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:19,799
The free man has a lot to tell, and
is ready to tell the story of his

157
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,470
life to anyone who cares to listen.

158
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,676
Free Man has, indeed, 
a message to put across.

159
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,983
The slave has no message, 
has no story. He is silent.

160
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:47,459
The slave lacks the capacity not
only of speaking, as a matter of fact,

161
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:55,734
but of noise making, 
or sound-emitting as well.

162
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,070
He's silent.

163
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,505
Not only wordless,

164
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,240
he's voiceless.

165
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,944
He is a mute being.

166
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:12,618
He is as quiet as the placid
lake on a quiet spring day.

167
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:21,794
What is responsible for the dumbness and
muteness of the slave, of the bonded man?

168
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,362
What is responsible for it?

169
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,130
After all, he is a human being.

170
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:36,575
I believe that responsible for it is the
lack of a basic experience, namely the

171
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:45,718
experience of suffering or the experience
of distress, which is perhaps the most

172
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,388
central aspect of the human "I" awareness.

173
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,257
You know, many

174
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,927
times, Descartes defined
man -- it's famous.

175
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,963
Descartes defined man.

176
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,265
Who is man?

177
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,266
What is man?

178
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,370
So, Descartes answered, man is a thinker.

179
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,707
Cogito ergo sum, an old
saying by Descartes.

180
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,511
I think, most probably, I do exist.

181
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:17,049
Of course, it's still
doubtful, but I do exist.

182
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:23,255
I would say Judaism's opinion of man
is -- and don't say it is a pessimistic

183
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,090
approach, it's not pessimistic at all.

184
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:34,566
I would say it in Latin, dolorem ferre
or pati, I suffer, ergo sum, I do exist.

185
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:42,474
The experience of suffering is
an integral part of the human "I"

186
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,244
consciousness, of the human awareness.

187
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,348
And I'll tell you my definition
is superior to Descartes'.

188
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,385
I mean, don't -- I'm not so great.

189
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,987
I'll tell you why.

190
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,857
Because Descartes' definition
applies to the devil, too.

191
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,094
Mephisto is an excellent thinker.

192
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,801
So, Mephisto can also say, 
cogito ergo sum.

193
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,971
But my definition, dolorem ferre or

194
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,175
pati ergo sum, is not
applicable to the devil.

195
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,543
The devil doesn't suffer.

196
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,813
Only a genuine human being suffers.

197
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:30,589
The slave lacks that experience
of dolorem ferre or pati ergo sum.

198
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,360
At this juncture,

199
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,030
let me introduce
something very elementary.

200
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:43,702
It almost borders on the vulgar,
but I have to introduce it.

201
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,838
I can't help myself.

202
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:51,710
The distinction between two
phenomena to which man is exposed,

203
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,881
namely, pain and suffering.

204
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,517
In Hebrew, it would be machov or

205
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,386
ke'ev and sevel.

206
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,159
Pain is a natural sensation.

207
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:13,665
It's basically a physiological reaction
on the part of the organism to any

208
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,837
kind of abnormality, particularly
to any kind of tissue pathology.

209
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,810
It is, as Aristotle upheld,
he knew -- he was a physician

210
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,846
himself, a naturalist, a physician.

211
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,519
He said that pain is the mechanical signal

212
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,692
which man receives whenever his
physical existence is menaced

213
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,795
or threatened from within.

214
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,735
It is, so to say, an integral part
of the security system of the body.

215
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,572
And apparently, the body -- the
security system of the body is, by

216
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,241
far, superior to the security
system of the White House.

217
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,412
[Laughter]

218
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,624
This instinctual reaction

219
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:22,768
is, as it is self-evident, immediate
and non-reflective, and it is not

220
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,170
restricted to humans.

221
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:31,009
The beast in the fields, the brute
in the woods, is also exposed

222
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,212
to and acquainted with pain.

223
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:45,724
In contrast to pain, suffering is not a
sensation, not at all, but an experience.

224
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:52,698
Suffering, basically, is a spiritual
reality, not a physiological

225
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,199
reality, a physical sensation.

226
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,033
Not at all.

227
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:03,709
It's a spiritual reality with
which only humans are confronted.

228
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,647
The animal has pain,
yes, but does not suffer.

229
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:17,322
This spiritual reality is usually
encountered by man whenever he stands in

230
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:24,830
danger to lose the sense either of his
existential security, as it is in the case

231
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,468
of an incurable disease rachmana litzlan.

232
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:33,639
If one is incurably ill, it's
not only a question of pain.

233
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,741
Pain, you have painkillers now.

234
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,876
More or less, medicine
knows how to control pain.

235
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:42,714
With the problem of suffering,
medicine cannot control suffering.

236
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:49,821
Or when he stands to lose his
existential dignity, as it is in

237
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,724
the case of public humiliation.

238
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:57,396
If a person is publicly
humiliated, he suffers.

239
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:05,871
He lost something, something of his
human awareness, the aspect of dignity.

240
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,607
When he's incurably ill, he suffers.

241
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,644
Not only is he exposed to pain;
again, he's losing something.

242
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,379
What does he stand to lose?

243
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,982
The existential awareness.

244
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:28,026
Whenever a merciless, indifferent, 
sometimes cruel, sense of reality clashes

245
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,230
with the human need of awareness,

246
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:37,002
man suffers and finds himself in distress.

247
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,072
The slave

248
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:46,345
is certainly exposed to pain, so is
the animal, as we have said before.

249
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:57,856
When the slave meets with pain, he reacts
like the brute does – with uttering a

250
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:08,867
sharp and shrill sound – he also reacts,
and he utters a sharp and shrill sound.

251
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,503
However, I would just call it a howl.

252
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,040
The howl of the beast, as well

253
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:22,514
as the shriek of the slave,
lasts just a split second.

254
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:33,592
And it dies suddenly in the darkness
and in the hush of the night.

255
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:38,330
In a split second, all is silent again.

256
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:47,039
There is no aftermath to pain sensation
-- to the pain sensation of the slave.

257
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,142
There is no follow-up.

258
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,244
There's no complaint.

259
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,080
There's no request.

260
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,182
There's no protest.

261
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,951
There's no question, why and what.

262
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:11,797
The agonizing howl is heard for an
infinitesimal period, and it is solely due

263
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,000
 to the convulsive reflexes of the body.

264
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,601
That's all.

265
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:26,778
The slave does not know suffering since he
lacks the very "need" awareness which

266
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:34,720
generates suffering if it clashes
with an indifferent everyday reality.

267
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,693
He is never in distress because he has
no human needs – an emphasis upon human,

268
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,230
upon the adjective – 
he has no human needs.

269
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:53,805
The needs of a slave are
like a shriek, not human.

270
00:22:54,139 --> 00:23:01,012
The etiology of his needs is
exclusively biological, not human.

271
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:09,855
Former inmates of the concentration
camps -- and I spoke with many -- told

272
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:16,661
me that with the passage of time,
they got used to everything.

273
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:24,770
Nothing disturbed them,
nothing surprised them anymore.

274
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,308
They were totally, totally
anesthetized against suffering.

275
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,580
Even the sharpness of pain
was considerably reduced.

276
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,384
The slave is silent.

277
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,021
He does not cry in a human fashion.

278
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,757
He certainly does not speak up.

279
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:56,001
He emits, of course, he emits a
shriek, but not a human sound.

280
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:03,008
Certainly, you don't hear
him pronounce a word.

281
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,647
I'm interested -- I am by
nature, I'm not a philosopher,

282
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,682
but I have a pretty good mind.

283
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,453
I have a sense for homiletics.

284
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,721
And to me, a thought,

285
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:21,092
no matter how well defined,
is incomplete as long as

286
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:26,565
I don't have a Midrash or an Aggadah
to support it, to back it up.

287
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:36,741
Let me introduce a Zohar, a beautiful
Zohar, but it's more than homiletics.

288
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:42,914
The Zohar projects here a beautiful picture
of the slave, of the silent slave.

289
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,083
I'll read it.

290
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,620
I have the text in Aramaic,
but you'll permit me to

291
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,088
read it in English, right.

292
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,696
Moses possessed the voice.

293
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,033
However, his speech was in bondage.

294
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:09,941
You know the story, Moshe told the
Almighty that he has uncircumcised

295
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:15,313
lips, he's a stutterer, so the
Zohar interprets it symbolically.

296
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:20,785
Not that it was physically, his
lips were physically uncircumcised,

297
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:26,625
but spiritually, he could not speak
because his speech was in bondage.

298
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,829
It's a literal translation of
the milei d'la havei b'galuta.

299
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,232
He was in bondage, and he
could not pronounce the words.

300
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,736
His lips were uncircumcised.

301
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,740
That's why he refused to go to Pharaoh.

302
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,944
The lips were enslaved.

303
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:53,151
“I cannot”, Moses said, “utter sounds”.

304
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:59,391
“I can”, Moses said, “utter
sounds, but not words”.

305
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,995
Before Moses came -- and the
Zohar continues to tell us

306
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,297
a very strange story.

307
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:11,770
Before Moses came, not only
speech but even sound was not present.

308
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:22,047
With Moses' appearance, the
voice was found or was restored,

309
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,418
yet it was a wordless sound.

310
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,754
The word was still in exile.

311
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:38,096
Only when the people, with Moses,
came to the Mount Sinai and the law

312
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:46,438
was given, the word was rediscovered
and was united with the voice,

313
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,242
and the word was spoken.

314
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:58,650
Interesting it is, that the Zohar
here speaks of three phases within

315
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,987
the process of geulah, of redemption.

316
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,122
First phase,

317
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,625
the stage of total silence.

318
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,262
This means total slavery, total bondage.

319
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,401
Second, that of sound but not of speech.

320
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,672
Third, that of total speech,

321
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,109
clear, unequivocal speech.

322
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:30,415
The first one, total silence,
characterizes slavery.

323
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,854
The last one, clear
speech, full redemption.

324
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:44,329
The middle one, when the person begins to move from the silent mute periphery

325
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:53,571
toward the center of speech, the process
of geulah sets in and the man is on

326
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,541
his way to complete redemption.

327
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:01,880
Before Moses came, there
was not even a voice.

328
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,582
No sound was heard.

329
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,220
No complaint was lodged against them.

330
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,590
No sigh, no cry was

331
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:24,202
uttered, just an agonizing, inhuman shriek
used to penetrate the hush or the weird

332
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:30,075
silence of an otherwise quiet night.

333
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,544
The slaves were silent.

334
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,613
They were gloomy but voiceless.

335
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:43,288
The women did not cry, did not protest,
did not fight, did not put up resistance

336
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:50,662
when their infants were snatched away
from their arms and drowned in the Nile.

337
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,967
The men kept quiet when they were

338
00:28:55,967 --> 00:29:02,674
mercilessly tortured by 
the slave drivers.

339
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:07,112
Yes, they felt pain, but
they did not suffer at all.

340
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,048
They took torture for granted.

341
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,686
They thought this is the way it should be.

342
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,490
They had no needs.

343
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,695
They lacked one awareness, the
"need" awareness, the awareness

344
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,832
of dolorem ferre ergo sum.

345
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:39,210
Moses, by his defending the helpless
Jew who was beaten by the Egyptian

346
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:46,651
slave driver, restored sensitivity to
the dull slaves, to the poor Hebrews.

347
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:55,326
They suddenly realized, in effect,
in a split second, they realized that

348
00:29:55,326 --> 00:30:01,666
all that pain which they took for granted,
hundreds of years -- we don't know

349
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,868
exactly how many years
they spent in Egypt, but

350
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,304
they took pain for
granted hundreds of years.

351
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:13,411
All that pain, all that anguish, all
that humiliation and endless torture are

352
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,979
unwarranted.

353
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:19,317
They realized suddenly,
unjustified, uncalled

354
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,822
for, that all the cruelty, greed,
intolerance of man vis-à-vis his

355
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,791
fellow man is evil, human madness.

356
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:32,463
They suddenly became perplexed, confused.

357
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,133
They were not confused before,
because they understood everything.

358
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,101
That's what they thought.

359
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,703
They took it for granted.

360
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,039
They didn't protest against reality.

361
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,775
Reality cannot be changed.

362
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,778
But suddenly, they

363
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,614
became perplexed, confused.

364
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:57,388
And in this confusion and
perplexity, usually suffering

365
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,325
comes, anguish comes.

366
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,462
Suddenly,

367
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,599
they began to protest.

368
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:14,072
I mean, the story of the Russian
Jewry is exactly, beautifully

369
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,840
portrayed by that Zohar.

370
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,043
You will find the same phases in

371
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:24,249
the process of redemption of
Russian Jews as the Zohar describes

372
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,653
concerning our ancestors in Egypt.

373
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,189
Suddenly, the

374
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:37,996
question arose, a wordless question
yet, the wordless demand for justice

375
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,798
and retribution, for change, et cetera.

376
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,570
In short, their silence was gone.

377
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,107
Moses brought to the Jews the voice.

378
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:57,382
And the voice means the
awakening of an emotional

379
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:04,989
awareness of need, or the consciousness
of delorem ferre, of pati, and I want to

380
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,759
understand why I am supposed to suffer.

381
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:19,737
Suddenly, the existence of the
poor Hebrews in Egypt became not a

382
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:24,309
speaking one but a vocal existence.

383
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:32,383
They engaged in noise-making, in
emitting sounds, into a vocal existence.

384
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,852
The voice was restored to them.

385
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,722
And interesting is how the Bible tells us:

386
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,126
"Vayehi ba'yamim ha'rabim ha'hem va'yamas
melech Mitzrayim vayei'anchu Bnei

387
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,331
Yisrael min ha'avodah va'yizaku va'taal
shavasom el ha'Elokim min ha'avodah."

388
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:50,368
And it came to pass in the course of
the many days that the king of Egypt

389
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,937
died, and the Children of Israel sighed

390
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:57,208
by reason of the bondage, and they
cried, and their cry came up unto God.

391
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,444
So, there's a very simple question.

392
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,313
This happened after Moses'
appearance in Egypt.

393
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,816
What happened before he appeared in Egypt?

394
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:09,520
Why didn't they cry before
the Moses episode took place?

395
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,292
Why were they silent during the
hundreds of years that they spent in

396
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:18,162
slave camps prior to Moses' appearance?

397
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:26,671
Apparently, their pre-Mosaic
existence was a mute and silent one.

398
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:32,176
They lacked the basic "need" awareness.

399
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,380
They experienced no need.

400
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:43,488
If you have no need, you
don't know the secret that

401
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,858
freedom is indispensable and that

402
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,228
freedom is the greatest of human needs.

403
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:57,335
Hence, they were in no
conflict with reality.

404
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,238
And that conflict with reality

405
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:07,278
between the human need and reality
generates suffering and distress.

406
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,850
The voice is restored to man

407
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:23,494
at the very instant his emotional "need"
awareness awakens, the very instant

408
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,597
he becomes sensitive to human pain.

409
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,368
Not just pain, I'm saying human pain.

410
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:40,711
However, speech comes later,
appears much later, with the birth

411
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,115
not of the awareness of need but

412
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,752
with the birth of the logos of need.

413
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,557
There is not only awareness of need.

414
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,860
I feel, I have a desire, I have an urge.

415
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,565
I am driven to obtain something.

416
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,432
Not only that,

417
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:06,804
this is, I would say, an
emotional awareness of need.

418
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,372
It's very important.

419
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,640
It's the basis.

420
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,711
But apart from the emotional awareness
of need, there is a logos of need.

421
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,548
 I understand why -- I want to understand why I need it.

422
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,685
What is the purpose?
And how can I get it?

423
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,757
When I become aware of my needs,  

424
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,231
so I am already -- I get my voice, my voice is restored.

425
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:39,303
 But the word is given to me and I become not only aware of my need,

426
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,341
but I begin to understand my need.

427
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,476
Not only understand my need, 

428
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:51,115
I understand also the method in which I could gratify that need.

429
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:57,688
Speech, however, appears much later with the birth of the logos of the need,

430
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:01,092
or with the emergence of a cognitive,

431
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:10,768
value-oriented, or let us use the term, axiological, "need" awareness.

432
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:15,573
There is an emotional "need" awareness , which is not as yet value-oriented.

433
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,477
There is a "need" awareness
if one is addicted to drugs.

434
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,112
It's also a "need" awareness.

435
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,981
If I'm addicted to alcohol,
it's a "need" awareness.

436
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,983
It's a very strong awareness.

437
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,619
It's powerful.

438
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,254
You know that.

439
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,290
It may destroy a man.

440
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,428
But what is the addict lacking?

441
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,197
What is he lacking?

442
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,032
Not the "need" awareness.

443
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,968
He's lacking the logos of need,

444
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:52,143
or the relationship of an
emotional "need" awareness to a

445
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:58,182
value-oriented, cognitive awareness.

446
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,284
This is the logos of need.

447
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:07,925
And interesting is, that the Zohar
says Moses was the voice, 

448
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,994
but he had no words.

449
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:17,535
Even the great Moses, who was moving from
the silent periphery to the great center,

450
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:24,842
did not arrive at his destination before
he and his people reached Mount Sinai.

451
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:31,349
For while he

452
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:39,257
was need-conscious, he was the
first one to emit a human sound of

453
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,028
protest, of non-reconciliation of the

454
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:48,933
human being with reality, no
matter how powerful reality is

455
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,674
The first -- he actually emitted
the first meaningful cry.

456
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:04,749
He did not, as yet,
discover the logos of need,

457
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,319
which should

458
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:15,259
have bestowed upon him the word.

459
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:24,802
Yes, he felt that the situation was
abnormal and that change was inevitable.

460
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:30,041
However, he did not know what to do
in order to liberate the people from

461
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,611
the clutches of a monstrous reality.

462
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:40,785
He experienced, intuitively, shame
and disgrace of such a mute existence.

463
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:45,523
His "need" awareness was extremely
sensitive, yet he failed to formulate

464
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,627
his feelings in clear, unequivocal words.

465
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,932
He lacked the

466
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:58,936
logos of need, even though
he had the awareness of need.

467
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,340
The word was missing.

468
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:10,681
Moses protested, he killed the tyrant,
he rebuked the wicked Jew, et cetera.

469
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:15,820
Nevertheless, he did not believe that
those slaves would ever be liberated.

470
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,054
He didn't believe in it.

471
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,790
You know, God had an argument with him.

472
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:27,498
According to Midrashic interpretation,
a full week God spent arguing with

473
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:32,903
Moses to convince him that those
slaves, insensitive slaves, who took

474
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:38,809
everything for granted, are worthy
of liberation, and those slaves will

475
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:44,849
turn into a great mamlechet kohanim,
into a kingdom of priests.

476
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,351
The whole situation was bewildering.

477
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,154
Yes, Moses broke the silence.

478
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:55,926
He began to move toward the
living, speaking center; however,

479
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,195
the word was still missing.

480
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:03,267
The logos of need was
not revealed to Moses.

481
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:10,241
And that revelation took place
when Moses reached Mount Sinai.

482
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:16,180
Then, he understood the meaning
of liberation, and he also

483
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,418
understood his people, that his
people are a very funny group.

484
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:26,957
They can rise from a

485
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:34,832
silent existence to an existence
full of sound and song and

486
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:40,104
speech within seven weeks.

487
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:50,114
They can fall into a bottomless
abyss quickly, but they can

488
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,184
rise to the stars suddenly.

489
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,419
That Moses understood

490
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,887
at Mount Sinai.

491
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:02,293
And then, the word was bestowed upon

492
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,697
him, the greatest gift
that God bestows upon man.

493
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,740
Now, let me continue if you
are not tired to listen.

494
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,276
Slavery

495
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,747
is not only a political,
juridic institution.

496
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,451
It's not only a political,
juridic reality.

497
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,386
It's more than that.

498
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:36,427
It is even more than a
psychological reality.

499
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:43,200
Slavery, or bondage, is
an existential reality.

500
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,372
I would say, a modus essendi.

501
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,809
It's a way of life.

502
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:58,415
You'll ask me -- and certainly, you would

503
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:05,422
ask me if you wanted to interrupt
me -- how does existential

504
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,791
slavery express itself?

505
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,562
We know how juridic, political
slavery expresses itself.

506
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,463
We know that.

507
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:18,335
But how does existential slavery
demonstrate itself, manifest itself?

508
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,270
How?

509
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:19,870
What is it?

510
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,872
What kind of an existence is it?

511
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,910
I'll answer you immediately.

512
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,147
In a peripheral existence.

513
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,517
If a person leads a peripheral
existence,  

514
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,757
he is a slave existentially.

515
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:50,301
I'll tell you – I mean, luckily, I'm a
rabbi, as Dr. Levin told you, I'm a rav.

516
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,105
Unfortunately – not unfortunately,
gratefully – there was a secular

517
00:42:55,105 --> 00:43:02,079
Jewish writer who described the
existential slave in a beautiful manner.

518
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:09,987
I could have picked other quotations
from other writers, but I believe

519
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,389
he did it in a magnificent fashion.

520
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,358
This is Peretz.

521
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,293
We all know the story of 
Bontshe Shvayg.

522
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,595
Many of you know.

523
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,563
I don't know how many know.

524
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,099
If I were in my class, I would
tell you raise your hand, right?

525
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,402
Not those who know, those who don't know.

526
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,206
But there is

527
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,610
just at the beginning.

528
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,144
The whole story I don't like.

529
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,847
It's too sarcastic.

530
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,415
It's even cynical.

531
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:43,320
However, the description of Bontshe
Shvayg -- the name itself, shvayg,

532
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,256
means silence -- is beautiful.

533
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,762
Shall I read the beginning in Yiddish or
you want me to give you the translation?

534
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:52,429
In Yiddish.

535
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,964
Yiddish in the beginning,
all right, I understand.

536
00:43:53,964 --> 00:44:01,305
Peretz starts with the following
paragraph: "Da oyf der velt hot Bontshe

537
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,541
Shvayg's toyt gor keyn ayndruk gemakht.

538
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,913
Fregt imatsen becherem ver Bontshe Shvayg iz geven.

539
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:14,652
Bontshe hot shtil gelebt un iz shtil geshtorbn; 

540
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,888

541
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:24,595

542

543
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:35,873

546
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,684

keyner nisht bamertkt."

547
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,220
Now, it's my translation, I wanted to say.

548
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,591
Find fault, find it with me, not
with Peretz: Bontshe Shvayg's death

549
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,995
made no impression whatsoever.

550
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,998
No one knew who Bontshe was.

551
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,968
Bontshe lived mutely and died quietly.

552
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,740
Like a silent shadow, he
did pass through our world.

553
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:18,549
At Bontshe's circumcision, no toasts
were raised, no glasses were clinked.

554
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,853
At bar mitzvah, no rousing
speech was delivered.

555
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:29,827
He lived in anonymity like a
gray, minute grain of sand on the

556
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:35,666
beach of a stormy sea, among
millions of identical sand particles.

557
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,701
No one noticed

558
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:45,576
that one of the particles was picked up by
the storm wind and carried far, far away.

559
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,780
[Inaudible]

560
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,918
They are slaves, not in a juridic fashion

561
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,454
but in an existential sense.

562
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,390
They are faceless; they are nameless.

563
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,161
No one is interested in them.

564
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:10,601
No one is concerned with or about them.

565
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:18,008
No one rejoices in their presence,
and no one bemoans their absence.

566
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:25,349
They come and go like Peretz's
Bontshe Shvayg without leaving

567
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,285
a trace, without making a mark.

568
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,021
They are forgotten people.

569
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,457
The cemeteries are full of them.

570
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:43,567
The death notice and the obituary page
in a paper, if such a notice did appear,

571
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:50,340
or the inscription on the tombstone,
is the only reminder that somebody

572
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,078
existed somewhere, sometime ago.

573
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:06,924
Those people lack, like the slave
of antiquity, a "need" awareness.

574
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,527
They know not what suffering is.

575
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,729
They are, therefore, speechless.

576
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,898
They are even voiceless.

577
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:20,337
Man was endowed with voice
and speech in order to react.

578
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:24,942
God gave him speech and voice in
order to react in a human fashion

579
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:29,646
to suffering, in order to be able
to define and articulate his needs.

580
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,052
With the disappearance of
a "need" awareness, one

581
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,889
forfeits voice and speech as well.

582
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,827
But let me add something.

583
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:51,568
We have been speaking about some
people, like Bontshe Shvayg, who

584
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:55,339
lead a peripheral, silent existence.

585
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,607
This is not true.

586
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,945
May I use this term, Judaic
existentialism, because the oldest

587
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:08,685
book on existentialism is not Pascal
or Augustine but the Tehillim.

588
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,657
This is the oldest book on existentialism.

589
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:18,996
To attribute existentialism to
Augustine or to Pascal or to

590
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,666
Kierkegaard is simply plagiarism.

591
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,203
They all plagiarized the Tehillim.

592
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:36,113
Judaic existentialism has 
gone a step further.

593
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:44,554
It has frankly stated that not some of
the people lead a silent or peripheral

594
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,492
existence, they are bondsmen, slaves.

595
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,962
 This is true, but it's not the full truth. 

596
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,765
Judaism has frankly stated that

597
00:48:54,765 --> 00:49:03,273
all the people are existentially
peripheral, mute beings, fringe dwellers.

598
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:10,213
no matter how vocal and
no matter how energetic they are.

599
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:18,655
When the Ecclesiastes said, "Ki
ba'choshech ba u'va'choshech

600
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,893
yelech u'va'choshech shemo
yechuseh," for it comes

601
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:29,566
in vanity, and departs in darkness, and
the name thereof is covered with darkness.

602
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:39,609
He did not refer only to the timid soul,
to the poor and meek, the Bontshe Shvaygs,

603
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:44,481
but to everybody, to the great ruler,
to the daring warrior, to the captain

604
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,417
of industry, and to the famous orator.

605
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:56,560
No matter how prestigious an
existence he lives in his terms,

606
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:01,465
he lives on the outskirts of being.

607
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:12,209
We have developed before the
equation of silence and the

608
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,112
absence of a "need" awareness.

609
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,816
Judaism holds the view that no
individual has a right to boast that

610
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:25,355
he possesses the right sensitivity
to and knowledge of his needs.

611
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:30,594
Not even the most sophisticated
and the most enlightened person is

612
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,230
familiar with his genuine needs.

613
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,034
In fact, man is totally
ignorant, even of his most

614
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:41,838
cardinal needs, urges, and desires.

615
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:48,812
And here comes in a very strange
philosophical doctrine which plays

616
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,447
an important role in Judaism.

617
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:57,320
The double image doctrine, which plays
such a significant role in our philosophy

618
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,360
of sin and repentance, lies at the very
root of our pessimistic appraisal of

619
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,263
man's relationship to his own needs.

620
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,668
Sin in Judaism -- what I mean by the
double image theory is as follows.

621
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:18,942
Sin in Judaism, in contradistinction to
Christian theology since Augustine, is

622
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,379
not within man but extraneous to man.

623
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,381
It's something foreign to man.

624
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:32,389
The cause of sin is to be found
not in man, not in genuine man, but

625
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:36,860
in the identification of man with
the wrong image,

626
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:43,867
with a phony “I” awareness.

627
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:51,007
If man identifies himself with
a pseudo, with the pseudo “I”,

628
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:58,281
with a phony “I” awareness, then
that identification breeds sin.

629
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,751
What is repentance according to Judaism?

630
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,522
Maimonides formulated it in one sentence.

631
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:10,026
Repentance is the consequence
of rediscovery of the genuine

632
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,629
“I”, of the genuine image,

633
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,400
and sin means the wrong identification. 

634
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,971
Now, let us draw a very simple

635
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:27,844
conclusion. If Man has a tendency to
identify himself with the wrong “I”

636
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:36,987
personality, then he'll also want to
respond to the needs of that personality.

637
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,090
We are very ambitious.

638
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:44,394
As a matter of fact, modern
man has countless needs,

639
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,930
but they don't belong to him.

640
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,634
They are needs of somebody else.

641
00:52:54,771 --> 00:53:01,111
In a word, not only some people live
on the periphery, but all of us.

642
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:08,218
Man, with the wrong table of
needs is not a full being.

643
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:17,961
And at this point, another Judaic
doctrine comes to the fore,

644
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,997
namely the activist doctrine.

645
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:24,701
Activist is probably a very fashionable
word among the Russian Jews who

646
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:29,039
call them -- those who stand up
and speak are called activists.

647
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,944
But it is a Judaic activist
doctrine of self-redemption.

648
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,716
What does this doctrine say?

649
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,520
Maimonides, in my opinion – I don't know
whether some historians will agree with me

650
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,724
or not – in my opinion, this is a central
doctrine in Maimonides' Moreh Nevuchim.

651
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,828
It comes to expression, unfortunately,
not in this first part, and not in

652
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,830
the middle part, but in the last part.

653
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,099
Usually, historians forget
about the last part.

654
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,704
The story is about the Alshich, an
old Jew said that he became a heretic,

655
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,272
an apikores, because of the Alshich.

656
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:07,777
Because the Alshich has the habit of
formulating maybe 20, 25 questions, and

657
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,746
then he begins to resolve the questions.

658
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,282
It was Shabbos, and the Jew
was tired after the meal.

659
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,586
So, the questions he did read,
but the answers, by the time he

660
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,357
was supposed to read the answers,
he was asleep, sound asleep.

661
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,628
So, he was -- after a certain
period of time, he found himself

662
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,063
full of questions without answers.

663
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,000
This is the trouble with
Maimonides, that actually this

664
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,937
theory was expounded by Maimonides

665
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,940
in the third section of Moreh Nevuchim.

666
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,809
What does this theory say?

667
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:45,048
I believe this doctrine says as follows.

668
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:52,455
Man comes into our world as a hyletic – I
mean, I'm using the Aristotelian jargon,

669
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,824
but I don't have a better word for that.

670
00:54:54,824 --> 00:55:00,163
It means what we call in our
traditional medieval philosophical

671
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,798
jargon, chomer hiyuli.

672
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,566
I mean, some people heard it.

673
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,804
Chomer hiyuli means there is
potency, but there is no actuality.

674
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,140
It's called hyle in Greek.

675
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:15,845
He comes as a hyletic, 
amorphous being.

676
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,484
He is created, of course,
in the image of God.

677
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:31,328
However, this image is a
challenge, is an idea, or

678
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,464
I would rather say it's an ideal.

679
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:39,102
It's a twinkling star on a far horizon.

680
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:44,674
It is not a grant, a gratuitous grant, but

681
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:49,346
God gives man the divine
image just for the asking.

682
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:58,621
It is up to man to take an ideal and
translate it into a reality; to reach

683
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:04,561
out for the twinkling star, no matter
how distant man is from that star.

684
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:09,833
It's up to man to objectify himself,

685
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:18,875
to impress form upon a latent, formless,
even though a divine personality, and to

686
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:30,186
move from the hyletic, silent periphery to
the center of objective, formed reality.

687
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:34,324
This is basically the idea,
according to Maimonides.

688
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,861
I don't have to tell you that, 
the ideal of education.

689
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:47,570
The highest norm in Maimonidean
moral code is rather strange.

690
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,605
What would you say?

691
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,140
What would you say?

692
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,375
What would you say?

693
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,843
I mean, knowing Maimonides,

694
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,714
what does he consider
the highest moral norm?

695
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,283
A very short norm.

696
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,552
To be.

697
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,254
To exist.

698
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:05,989
Maimonides did

699
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,325
not have Hamlet's doubts
whether to be or not to be.

700
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:17,000
If it is to be, it means play, to exist.

701
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,336
But to exist, in Maimonides, means

702
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:27,644
to draw out of myself the genuine
“I”, which is sometimes hidden

703
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:32,949
in the distant recesses of my personality.

704
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,788
To be in a corporal sense,

705
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:47,530
to liberate oneself from the bondage
of a shadowy – and I'll use now

706
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,067
here also a Platonic term because
it says something which I cannot

707
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,604
translate – Plato spoke of “me on”.

708
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,206
“On” means being, reality.

709
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,843
“Me on” means non-reality,
half-reality, semi-reality.

710
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,612
Somehow, it's a chaotic state, I believe.

711
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,814
Man does exist, but not fully.

712
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:14,991
From the shadows of “me on” and make
man move toward the white spaces that

713
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:21,965
Plato calls “ontos on”, real being,
genuine being, full being, total being.

714
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,802
In the world of ontos on,

715
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:31,441
there is speech, there is sound,
there is color, there is song.

716
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:43,620
The world of me on is full of shadows.

717
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,854
And what is education for

718
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,223
Maimonides is to take man out

719
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,158
of this, basically, emigration.

720
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:54,030
The Russians don't like it, but actually,
to take man out of the realm of shadows

721
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,566
and place him in the realm of light;

722
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:02,672
take him out of the realm of silence,
muteness, and place him in the

723
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,909
realm of speech and the clear word.

724
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,516
How is it being done?

725
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:18,288
How do we achieve this
objectification of the human being?

726
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,556
How?

727
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,159
All right, it's a beautiful idea: to be!

728
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,328
To be in a total sense.

729
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,430
But how?

730
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,636
Judaism recommended
two acts of redemption.

731
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,207
Try to guess.

732
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,815
One, through knowledge.

733
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,954
It means in our vocabulary,
it means through Torah.

734
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:58,828
The redemption of the intellect
or objectification redemption of

735
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,699
the intellect through knowledge,
through cognition, through Torah.

736
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:07,437
Second, through tefillah.

737
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:14,143
The redemption -- of course,
the Torah redeems the intellect.

738
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,646
What does tefillah redeem?

739
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,817
The "need" awareness or the

740
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:25,822
awareness of dolorem
ferre, or pati, ergo sum.

741
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,657
It's important in Judaism.

742
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,892
It's the basic awareness in a human being.

743
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,130
With your permission, I'll

744
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:40,269
just explain in a few sentences
how does the intellectual

745
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:45,742
object – the process of objectification,
the process of intellectual

746
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,211
objectification – how does it function?

747
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:53,349
And it will facilitate my
task of explaining to you

748
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,653
how the objectification via

749
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,755
tefillah occurs.

750
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:06,062
We all know the story

751
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:16,406
that is related in Nidah Daf Lamed 30b.

752
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,641
I mean, if someone wants to check 

753
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:19,709
I have it.

754
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,576
I cut it out.

755
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,112
I have it right here, but
I'll give my own translations.

756
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,748
It's much better than
the standard translation.

757
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:29,986
But if somebody should doubt my word and
say, I mean, it's my own story, I made

758
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:34,223
it up, so I have it right over here.

759
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:40,863
We all know the story told in Tractate
Nidah about the angel who teaches

760
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:48,037
Torah, the whole Torah from beginning
to end, to the embryo or fetus during

761
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:54,077
the nine months of its incubation -- the
greatest scholar is the embryo -- and

762
01:01:54,077 --> 01:02:02,752
who strikes the baby upon its face,
upon its mouth, immediately before

763
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:10,226
the baby is ready to see light
and is to be born, before birth.

764
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:16,566
And that same angel 
who taught the baby

765
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:21,571
the whole system of law, the
whole Torah from beginning to

766
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,742
end, makes it forget everything.

767
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,578
Of course, when a baby comes
into this world, we know very

768
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,280
well it doesn't know too much.

769
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:40,289
As a matter of fact, this story actually
was translated into a certain custom.

770
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:49,132
The reason why people visit the baby or
the mother on the Shabbat before the bris

771
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,903
is the tragedy which happened to the baby.

772
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:59,442
It's basically a condolence visit we pay
to the baby, that the baby's in mourning.

773
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:05,281
It was such a great scholar, and there
was no need to pay tuition and to look

774
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:10,386
for admission to some Ivy League college,
and suddenly, it has forgotten everything.

775
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:15,491
Jews are very sympathetic, merciful.

776
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,294
They pay a condolence visit.

777
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,063
Ha'makom yinachem, God should comfort.

778
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,734
That's what our task is.

779
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:32,041
The question is obvious.

780
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:42,718
If the angel makes the baby forget
everything he taught it, so then why did

781
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,822
he bother to teach the embryo at all?

782
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,257
It's a waste of time.

783
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,596
The answer, I believe, is
again obvious and clear.

784
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,033
When a Jew

785
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:05,608
studies Torah, he is confronted with
something which is not foreign to him, not

786
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:09,378
superimposed upon him from the outside.

787
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:18,287
He is confronted with something which is
not extraneous to him, but with something

788
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:24,126
which is intimate and known from before.

789
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,397
He knew all that once upon a time.

790
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:32,034
It was stored up in the
recesses of his memory.

791
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:37,540
Of course, he

792
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,878
studies his own stuff
by sheer association.

793
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:46,682
You know very well, by sheer association,
we are reminded of the Platonic doctrine

794
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,220
that learning is recalling, recollection.

795
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,855
It's the same doctrine.

796
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,892
What does it mean?

797
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:01,998
Learning means recollecting 
of something familiar.

798
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:09,438
The Jew studying Torah acts like
the amnesia victim who is trying

799
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:17,046
hard to reconstruct out of the
debris of his memory a beautiful

800
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:20,850
world which, intuitively, he knows.

801
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,051
He can prove it.

802
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,587
He enjoyed it once upon a time.

803
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:35,564
In other words, by learning Torah,
the Jew expands his own self.

804
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:42,371
To study means to objectify
and to redeem oneself from the

805
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:46,175
hyletic, from the silent existence.

806
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:53,449
By studying, a Jew heads straight toward
a charted, illuminated and speaking

807
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,252
existence, but everything is within him.

808
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,188
He draws it out of himself.

809
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:04,961
Education as drawing out of oneself.

810
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:10,232
That's exactly what Rabbi
Simlai -- the name of

811
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,568
the rabbi who taught this story is 

812
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:17,406
Rabbi Simlai -- wanted to convey to us.

813
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,947
Now, just

814
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:33,489
in short, I want to say intellectual
redemption of study, which is achieved

815
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:41,230
through study of Torah, has also the three
phases which the Zohar mentioned vis-à-vis

816
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,601
our ancestors in Egypt.

817
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:52,708
First of all, at the first stage, we
encounter silence, complete intellectual

818
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,379
insensitivity and total unconcern.

819
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,481
You may meet people,

820
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,650
they are not educated somehow.

821
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,019
It's not a question.

822
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,487
They didn't have the opportunity.

823
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,089
But they are totally unconcerned.

824
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:13,662
They don't possess this curiosity or,
what Aristotle called, the amazement,

825
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:17,566
the “why?” or “what?”, that man

826
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:23,672
willy-nilly utters when he is confronted
by the cosmos, by the universe.

827
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,573
They lack it.

828
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:25,841
Silence.

829
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,511
There is no awareness of need.

830
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,580
You start with every baby like that.

831
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,984
Unfortunately, some people
grow up with this awareness.

832
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:42,058
That world, during that period
of time, when man is unconcerned,

833
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,492
completely unconcerned, he's

834
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:46,028
not amazed and takes
everything for granted.

835
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,832
He simply doesn't react to
the beauty of the universe.

836
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,735
After all, God has showered so
much beauty upon this universe.

837
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,972
Nor does he react to the
intellectual aspect, to the

838
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,742
scientific question, why, what, how.

839
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,379
This is hyle.

840
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,682
Complete potentiality, but no actuality.

841
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,852
It is the world of shadows.

842
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,989
It is the world of silence.

843
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,827
Then comes the second phase.

844
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:26,235
As a teacher, I know that the
second phase is not the word.

845
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,904
Word is the idea, the voice.

846
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:35,711
It means the pupil – somehow the
pupil's voice was restored, or

847
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,180
the voice is restored to man.

848
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,817
It means you hear sounds but not words.

849
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,488
The awakening: it

850
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:51,994
characterizes the awakening of
cognitive curiosity and amazement.

851
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:56,098
Man begins to be annoyed
because he does not understand.

852
01:08:56,098 --> 01:09:00,002
He is troubled by something he
himself cannot define, and that

853
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:02,138
is the beginning of knowledge.

854
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,439
This is the voice.

855
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,541
This is a transitional stage.

856
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:11,080
Of course, at the end, at the
conclusion comes the word.

857
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,648
The word breaks through.

858
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:17,887
What is the word in the intellectual
world, in the academic world?

859
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,891
Clear and distinct cognition.

860
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:28,230
The intellect begins to speak.

861
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:33,502
In that moment, the intellect begins
to speak, to ask and to answer.

862
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,906
It's more important that the
intellect asks the question.

863
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,841
There's not always an answer.

864
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:41,277
There are no answers to all

865
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:48,517
questions, but begins to speak in
the clear accents of the logos.

866
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,587
Then, man finds himself

867
01:09:51,587 --> 01:10:00,429
objectified, redeemed and a citizen,
not of me on but of ontos on.

868
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:07,670
Now, let us ask, how does man
redeem himself through prayer?

869
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,372
This is actually my topic.

870
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:16,445
Judaism, in contradistinction to

871
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:21,750
mystical quietism

872
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,789
– and it's usually non-Jewish mysticism, the
Jewish mystics had a different approach

873
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:36,165
– but non-Jewish mysticism, throughout the
ages, recommended toleration of pain.

874
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,637
Judaism, in contradistinction to that

875
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:46,609
doctrine, wants man, as I said
already before, to cry out aloud

876
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,512
against any kind of pain, to react.

877
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,548
Judaism rejected Stoicism. 

878
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,984
Some people are Stoics.

879
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,919
Maimonides himself was a Stoic.

880
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,054
He couldn't help it.

881
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,023
It was a part of him.

882
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:08,030
But Judaism as a whole, the halachah is
opposed to Stoicism, to taking pain

883
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:13,636
quietly, graciously, with magnanimity.

884
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:23,045
It wants man to react indignantly to
all kinds of injustice or unfairness.

885
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:31,020
For Judaism holds the view that the
individual who displays immunity

886
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:41,063
to pain and suffering, who meekly
reconciles himself to the ugly,

887
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:46,435
disproportionate and unjust in life, who

888
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,337
does not shudder at the sight of

889
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:56,078
the Satan, the individual who has
no needs at all, whose needs are

890
01:11:56,078 --> 01:12:01,150
a few and easily gratified, that

891
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:08,357
individual will never be able to
appreciate beauty and goodness

892
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:15,030
and, particularly, to share in the
travail and the suffering of others.

893
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,968
Whoever permits his legitimate needs

894
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:28,911
to go unsatisfied will never be
sympathetic to the crying needs of others.

895
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:36,318
Human morality, which is based on
love and friendship, on sharing

896
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:43,258
in the travail of others, cannot
be practiced if the person's own

897
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,295
“needs” awareness is dull and meek.

898
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:54,069
If the individual himself knows not
what suffering is, then he'll never

899
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,772
share in the suffering of others.

900
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:00,809
Hence, Judaism rejected what

901
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,311
kind of an existence?

902
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,880
Probably aesthetic.

903
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,049
Aesthetic, yeah, but I have a better term.

904
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,519
The angelic existence.

905
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,521
You all know the Aggadah.

906
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:18,394
The angels appeared before the Almighty
and said they wanted the Torah.

907
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:24,633
Why would the Torah be given to sinful
man, frail man, weak man, mortal man?

908
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:29,805
And why not be given to the
angels, to the archangels, who

909
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,273
live forever?

910
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,043
And what did God answer?

911
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,913
I give the Torah to a people with needs.

912
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:43,552
Angels live in an existence without need,

913
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,256
and the Torah does not belong to them.

914
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:56,632
Therefore, prayer in Judaism
is again, unlike prayer in the

915
01:13:56,632 --> 01:14:00,736
mystical literature, bound up with

916
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:02,171
human needs,

917
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:09,411
human drives, human
urges, and human wants.

918
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:21,023
Out of the 19 benedictions in our Shemoneh
Esrei, in our Tefillat Amidah, 13 are

919
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,926
concerned exclusively with human

920
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:29,565
need, from Atah Chonen L'Adam
Daat until Shomei'a Tefillah.

921
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:41,376
And even two of the last three
benedictions, Retzeh and Sim Shalom,

922
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:53,222
are again concerned with need and they
display petitional, so to say, nature.

923
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,891
They are petitional benedictions.

924
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:05,133
Judaism was not too excited over
hymnal prayer or a thanksgiving prayer.

925
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,336
We know we have them.

926
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:12,841
We recite the Hallel on certain
occasions, and we recite Pesukei d'Zimra

927
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:17,679
every morning prior to the recital
of the benedictions of Kriat Shema.

928
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,413
Correct.

929
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:24,520
We have, you know, I mean– the Book
of Psalms is replete with hymns,

930
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,690
beautiful, magnificent hymns,
exalted hymns, but the hymn is

931
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,027
not the very essence of the Jewish prayer.

932
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,896
And the Jewish prayer,

933
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,965
the very essence, the very
substance of the Jewish prayer,

934
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:44,072
is petition, intercession,
asking, requesting, and sometimes

935
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,008
demanding from the Almighty.

936
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,176
It's very strange.

937
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,612
Christians don't understand it.

938
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:56,184
They have even trouble with
the Pater Noster, in the Lord's

939
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,687
Prayer, to give us our daily bread.

940
01:15:58,687 --> 01:15:59,454
They have trouble.

941
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,356
We ask more than bread.

942
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,327
We ask for luxuries sometimes.

943
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:12,301
And that's exactly what
Judaism wants us to do.

944
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:18,540
The person in need is summoned to pray.

945
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,843
And halachically, I could prove it
to you, but I have no time for that.

946
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,046
Prayer and tzarah.

947
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,681
you know what tzarah is, I mean?

948
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:32,154
Either you say it in Sephardic
dialect or in Ashkenazic

949
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,755
dialect, it's the same tzarah.

950
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:47,069
Prayer is inseparably linked
up, bound up with tzarah.

951
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,837
Who prays?

952
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,973
He who is in distress.

953
01:16:54,743 --> 01:17:01,116
"Min ha'meitzar karasi Kah," out
of the narrow straits I invoke God.

954
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:07,322
"Mi'maamakim kerasicha Adoshem,"
I invoke God de profundis,

955
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,792
from the depths in which I find myself.

956
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:14,663
"V'chi savo milchamah b'artzechem al ha'tzaar ha'tzorer es'chem,"

957
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,532
when we're at war with them,

958
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:19,067
then pray.

959
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:27,643
And this is true according to
Maimonides as well, and Nachmanides,

960
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,779
who dealt with the problem of
prayer from a halachic viewpoint.

961
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:35,550
Prayer and need are inseparably bound up.

962
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:46,194
If man does not experience min ha'meitzar,
narrowness, existential narrowness, if

963
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:53,402
man is not in distress, min ha'meitzar,
if he's not somewhere in subterranean

964
01:17:53,402 --> 01:18:01,076
depths, if he feels happy and contented,
there is halachically no need for prayer.

965
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,911
Doesn't have to join a temple or

966
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:07,916
synagogue, and can save a few dollars.

967
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,321
If man is happy,

968
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:21,997
contented, prayer not only is not
necessary but it's an absurdity.

969
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:29,104
Prayer is the result of this
consciousness, of a permanent crisis

970
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:35,310
consciousness, the consciousness
of dolorem ferre ergo sum.

971
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,312
This is prayer.

972
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,751
Of course, with

973
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,754
the awakening of the "need"
awareness , prayer is dependent

974
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,422
upon the "need" awareness.

975
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:51,993
If a man has a "need" awareness, then pray, ask, demand, request.

976
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:52,627
If you have

977
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:56,064
no "need" awareness, either your
needs are few, or you think you

978
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,668
have gratified all your needs,
then there is no need for prayer.

979
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:05,941
With the awakening of the "need"
awareness, prayer makes its entry.

980
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:13,248
Prayer at this stage -- and I would ask
for your attention -- at this stage,

981
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:20,122
is called tzaakah, Tzaddi-Ayin-Kuf-Hei,
tzaakah, not tefillah yet.

982
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,356
Not tefillah yet.

983
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,624
Tefillah is a higher word.

984
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:24,226
I'll explain what tefillah is.

985
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:29,030
Tzaakah, Tzaddi-Ayin-Kuf-Hei,
what does tzaakah mean in Hebrew?

986
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,367
Shriek, outcry.

987
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:38,974
And one of the attributes of the
Almighty is Shomei'a Kol Tzaakah.

988
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:45,747
He hearkens to the voice, to the cry,

989
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,916
to the shriek, to the howl.

990
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,719
He hearkens to it.

991
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:53,688
Not word, kol tzaakah.

992
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,657
You don't say Shomei'a Kol Tefillah.

993
01:19:55,657 --> 01:20:01,296
You don't say it because when God hearkens
to tefillah, then He hearkens to words.

994
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:04,366
But when it is about tzaakah,
there are no words yet.

995
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,068
Man hasn't discovered the logos of need.

996
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:11,239
He just discovered the awareness
of need, that he is a being

997
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,073
in need.

998
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:20,949
He is dependent, and the consummation of
the ideal of man, of his life – I mean,

999
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:26,221
the meaningfulness – can only be obtained
from somewhere else, not from within.

1000
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,558
Then, prayer is indispensable.

1001
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,993
But this is the logos.

1002
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:39,034
For the time being, it is
just tzaakah, just an outcry.

1003
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:46,074
There is as yet no word, no
sentence, even though the

1004
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,276
emotional awareness has awakened.

1005
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:54,082
The logos of need is
still dormant, silent.

1006
01:20:54,549 --> 01:21:00,822
There is, as yet, no clear
understanding of what one is crying for.

1007
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:06,094
There is, however, distress
and loud human weeping.

1008
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:12,167
Tzaakah is primordial prayer.

1009
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:17,906
The voice is restored;
the word is still missing.

1010
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:21,376
He prays because he's in narrow straits.

1011
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,211
He prays because

1012
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,779
he is in the depths.

1013
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:27,782
But for what he prays, he doesn't know.

1014
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:32,020
Did our ancestors in Egypt know
when they began to pray for what?

1015
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:38,293
Prayer was an expression of protest
against reality, against the present.

1016
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:41,529
But what?

1017
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,632
How it should be changed?

1018
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:44,566
What man wants?

1019
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,469
At this stage, he doesn't know as yet.

1020
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:52,874
Interesting is, I mean, just as this
is a parenthetical statement, that

1021
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:59,514
the service of Selichot, I mean, the
original service of Selichot, actually

1022
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,850
represents not tefillah but tzaakah.

1023
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,486
Short sentences.

1024
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:08,556
"Ana Adoshem hoshi'ah na."
Aneinu, aneinu, aneinu, you

1025
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:09,891
just repeat one word.

1026
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,661
Aneinu, answer, hearken,
aneinu, aneinu, aneinu.

1027
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,665
Later, it was elaborated and,
of course, transformed into

1028
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:22,971
literary creations, but at the
beginning, it was just an outcry, a

1029
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:27,709
shriek, a word whose meaning, I mean,
the worshipper did not understand.

1030
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:34,149
Aneinu, mi sh'anah l'Avraham Avinu
b'Har Hamoriah, aneinu, ateret libi.

1031
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:41,189
The shaliach tzibbur, the cantor, used to
say the sentence, the crowd couldn't read.

1032
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:43,291
They didn't know how to
formulate the prayer.

1033
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:49,064
They just answered in monosyllables
or just with one word.

1034
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:52,300
Aneinu, hoshana, hoshana, hoshana.

1035
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,270
This is the stage of tzaakah.

1036
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,105
A "need" awareness has

1037
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,440
awakened.

1038
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:06,147
Man feels reality has to
be corrected, changed.

1039
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:10,385
Man registers protest

1040
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,654
against reality, but

1041
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,658
he doesn't know what the substitute is.

1042
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,660
This is tzaakah.

1043
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,629
Let us continue.

1044
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:22,897
Now, we come to tefillah.

1045
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,734
Let us continue with our analysis.

1046
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:32,340
There is an inner contradiction
within the "need" awareness.

1047
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:37,746
I know my own opinion, I mean,
I've spoken so much about it

1048
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,015
and I mentioned it in my essay.

1049
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:44,586
The awareness of need is a
dialectical awareness, basically.

1050
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:45,920
It means it has

1051
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,522
an inner contradiction.

1052
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:55,397
On the one hand, it urges man, as I stated
before, to gratify his needs and warns

1053
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:58,299
him against any attempt to suppress them,

1054
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:02,904
since non-gratification is
contrary to human dignity.

1055
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,372
You see?

1056
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:09,377
The first aspect of the awareness
of need is not only just that I

1057
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,679
am in need: a statement of fact.

1058
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,783
But there is a normative
element, a normative aspect.

1059
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:16,484
Gratify.

1060
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,752
Try to gratify your needs.

1061
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:23,892
Don't suppress them because suppression
of needs and the denial of gratification

1062
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:27,195
to needs is contrary to the

1063
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:31,132
divine scheme of creation
and to dignity of man.

1064
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:40,341
However, there is another
aspect in the awareness of need.

1065
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:45,613
It also warns man against
total gratification

1066
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,017
of his needs.

1067
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,453
Some needs,

1068
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:59,260
and to our chagrin, the most pressing
ones, must and will never be gratified.

1069
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,696
That's what Judaism says.

1070
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:06,501
The awareness of need is
of a dialectical nature.

1071
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,203
It has an inner contradiction.

1072
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:12,540
There are two aspects which
are mutually exclusive.

1073
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,077
One aspect is: gratify your needs.

1074
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:20,849
Gratification is incumbent upon man.

1075
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,651
It is incumbent upon man
to gratify his needs.

1076
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:29,491
If man tries to suppress his
needs like monastic philosophy or

1077
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:39,701
asceticism would recommend, then
he's actually lowering his dignity.

1078
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:43,571
On the other hand, there's another aspect.

1079
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,540
Total gratification.

1080
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,710
To become an addict?

1081
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,713
To become a voluptuary?

1082
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:57,185
To gratify every need 
and totally gratify?

1083
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,188
Forbidden.

1084
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:01,422
It's forbidden.

1085
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,191
You shouldn't do that.

1086
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,559
Some needs

1087
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:10,632
deserve to be gratified, some needs
should be suppressed or, rather,

1088
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:14,702
excluded from the human "need" awareness.

1089
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:18,306
Suppression is the word
which Judaism does not like.

1090
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:24,879
The "need" awareness tells man

1091
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:33,321
that total gratification will in the
long run, could in the long run, destroy

1092
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,790
man's dignity and man's humanity.

1093
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,061
What should man do in such a case?

1094
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,597
What should he do?

1095
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:48,169
He's caught in the
crucible of contradiction.

1096
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:52,774
What advice should he follow?

1097
01:26:52,774 --> 01:27:02,617
Advice number one, gratification of
needs is a human performance and man

1098
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:10,158
will enhance his dignity by gratifying
his needs, or should he listen and pay

1099
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:13,228
attention to the advice to 
just the reverse?

1100
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:19,867
Namely, total gratification
of needs is forbidden.

1101
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:25,640
You will lose your human dignity
if you'll succumb to need.

1102
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:33,982
Of course, Judaism comes forward
with a complete axiological

1103
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:36,284
doctrine of human needs.

1104
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:43,258
It tries to teach man which needs should
and which should not be gratified.

1105
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,228
This is basically the essence of halachah.

1106
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:48,129
You'll ask

1107
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:54,569
me what halachah is recommending man,
the modus operandi, how man should relate

1108
01:27:54,569 --> 01:28:01,075
himself to both aspects of the "need"
awareness, to the aspect which recommends

1109
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:08,416
gratification and to the aspect which
tells him total gratification is insane

1110
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,918
and means destruction of the personality.

1111
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:19,694
There are criteria by which one may be
guided in his attempt to treat his needs,

1112
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:23,531
his "need" awareness on a selective basis.

1113
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:26,367
The halachic prayer, it's hard for me

1114
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:29,537
now – time is almost up.

1115
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:35,209
You don't know how much time
I allocated to myself, huh?

1116
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,413
I didn't ask you.

1117
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:51,359
So, I could prove it to you by
studying each brachah separately.

1118
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:56,998
For the brachos, for those
benedictions contain not only the

1119
01:28:56,998 --> 01:29:04,005
fact that man has needs but also
a scale, a hierarchy of needs.

1120
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:09,177
Instructs man to distinguish
between worthwhile, constructive

1121
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,212
gratification of need

1122
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:14,982
and a disjunctive one.

1123
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:22,557
It means that in addition to
the awareness of need, man

1124
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:23,691
must what?

1125
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:28,896
Must also possess the logos, I
mentioned before, the logos of need.

1126
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:37,372
Man should not only be sensitive
to his needs but also know

1127
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,574
and evaluate them as well.

1128
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:44,545
He's supposed to relate them
to moral norms and their

1129
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:48,716
gratification, thus ethicized.

1130
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:53,454
There are no neutral 
activities in Judaism.

1131
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:58,793
There is no division of sectors
into mundane and sacred.

1132
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:04,565
Every sector in human life can either
serve as a sanctuary for God or

1133
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:10,538
deteriorate into a madhouse of profanity
and absurdity, and it's up to man

1134
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,808
to decide.

1135
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:22,283
And the main decision, the most
important decision that man makes, is

1136
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:28,156
concerned with the problem of
need, which needs be gratified

1137
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:31,692
and which eliminated 
and disowned by man.

1138
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:37,498
At this stage – and this is in
the Shemoneh Esrei – there is

1139
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:42,136
a hierarchy of needs, beginning
with Atah Chonen and closing,

1140
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,071
concluding with Shomei'a Tefillah.

1141
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:51,179
At this stage, prayer is not
just a shriek, not just a cry,

1142
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:55,149
and not just a howl anymore.

1143
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:02,290
It is rather a well-defined
thought, a clear conception.

1144
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:07,462
Therefore, at this stage, when
man introduces the logos of

1145
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,731
needs, it turns into tefillah.

1146
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:16,337
What the exact semantics of tefillah, of
the term tefillah is, we do not know.

1147
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,738
It's very hard.

1148
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:20,208
There are many opinions,
but one thing we do know.
