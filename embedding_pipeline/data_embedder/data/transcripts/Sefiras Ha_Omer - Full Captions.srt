1
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,358
 When I was a young boy...

2
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,930
when I was young, I considered them, 

3
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,934
considered those issues, as sensational.

4
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:34,180
And as a matter of fact, there
are about four or five issues

5
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,918
about which the Rishonim disagree.

6
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,455
And those issues I would like simply

7
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:48,795
to point those issues out to you

8
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,264
and discuss them just for a short time.

9
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,566
It would not take long.

10
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:02,742
In general, Sefiras HaOmer, there
are, I would say four issues in

11
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:08,982
Sefiras HaOmer, as I said before,
which are almost sensational.

12
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,119
Do you know of

13
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,257
machlokes with regard to Sefiras HaOmer?

14
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,426
Central, basic machlokes.

15
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:26,432
...controversies with
regard to Sefiras HaOmer.

16
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,269
Basic, I don't mean peripheral machlokes.

17
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,803
There are many machlokes peripheral.

18
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,672
What?

19
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:37,710
[Answer from Audience -- One
mitzvah, 49 mitzvos?] 49?

20
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,211
What?

21
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:42,482
[Answer from Audience -- One
complete mitzvah one mitzvah or

22
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,716
each night is a mitzvah...] No.

23
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,718
This to me no issue.

24
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,656
This to me no issue,
because it is no issue.

25
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,757
No.

26
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:58,331
I say, and that's ... chakirah...
already abstraction here.

27
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:05,038
Simply halacha lemaaseh Rishonim disagree,
I mean about, but I would say four issues.

28
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,739
Four controversies.

29
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,574
What?

30
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,476
[Answer from Audience -- Deoraysa,
derabanan.] Correct.

31
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,178
Correct, correct.

32
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,617
The mitzvah itself bizman hazeh,
is it mideoraysa or miderabanan?

33
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,217
Fine.

34
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,321
We will return to this problem.

35
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,155
Next.

36
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,057
What would you suggest next?

37
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:28,394
Audience -- Weeks or days?] Huh?

38
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,830
What, what?

39
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,801
[Answer from Audience.] 

40
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,105
Yomim or whether
shavuos should be included in the yomim.

41
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,445
What is the machlokes haRishonim if there
is a machlokes, of course a machlokes?

42
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:53,286
What does the machlokes consist of?

43
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,588
With regard to what?

44
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,657
With regard to the nusach,
to the text of sefirah.

45
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:05,198
One opinion is the text of sefirah should
be read, I mean should be found in the,

46
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:11,137
the sefirah should be, the way we do,
this is the proper, the proper method.

47
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,373
What is our minhag?

48
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,108
What is our practice?

49
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,077
[Answer from Audience -- Yomim and shvuos.]

50
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:22,882
Now yomim and shvuos is ... Rishonim,
there's a machlokes, I

51
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,517
mean the Gemara Ameimar.

52
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,287
Yomim ushvuos, if we are speaking about
yomim ushvuos in general, you have a

53
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:35,595
machlokes in the Gemara Ameimar ... Devei
Rav Ashi, Rav Ashi and Ameimar.

54
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:40,500
The machlokes in the Gemara whether
there is a mitzvah shvuos bizman hazeh.

55
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,604
But in the Gemara, the question is if

56
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,540
there is a mitzvah shvuos bizman hazeh.

57
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,975
So what do you do?

58
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,244
Do you have to mention
shavuos every night?

59
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,480
Or once in seven days?

60
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,317
The mitzvah lememnei yomei,
mitzvah lememnei shvuei.

61
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:05,358
Minyan shvuei is a mitzvah which
is binding throughout the period of

62
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:10,730
sefirah, because if mitzvah lememnei
shvuei is not only the weeks,

63
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:19,906
even the yomim, for instance, you had
to say, let us take from yesterday, or

64
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:26,446
before yesterday, say, Hayom araba'a
asar yom shehem shnei shavuos ba'omer.

65
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,483
This is according to everybody you have
got, because, I have got to mention

66
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:35,555
it, because if we pass mitzvah lememnei
yomei mitzvah lememnei shvuei, the

67
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,625
shvuei means, what does shavua mean?

68
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,093
Every night?

69
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:48,434
Or shavua means every night on which
the week is completed, completed.

70
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,840
There are, our minhag is that the
mitzvah shvuei applies not only to whole

71
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,477
weeks, but fractional weeks as well.

72
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:03,149
... what we asked last night, was
sheheim chamisha asar yom.

73
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,920
So I have to repeat, sheheim
shnei shavuos, sheheim

74
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,656
shnei shavuos veyom echad.

75
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,625
Or shnei yomim or shlosha yomim.

76
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,328
Is the integration of

77
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:20,166
the week out of the yomim

78
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,704
is also a part of minyan hashavuos.

79
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:32,345
Minyan hashavuos is not only when you have
entities, when you have separate entities,

80
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:38,518
but minyan hashavuos is even if one, if
the end the shavuos are, for instance

81
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,187
shavuos you have three days, three days,

82
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:49,629
I have three shavuos and five
days ba'omer, is also the mitzvah.

83
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,998
The mitzvah is the process of integration.

84
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:57,036
I mean, of counting up to seven
and integrate the seven, and

85
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,540
we'll start with 14 and so forth.

86
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:06,078
This according to most Rishonim, many
Rishonim, not most of them, many Rishonim

87
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,486
is as long as the shavua is not
complete, it's not mentioned.

88
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:18,791
If for instance, I mention only
hayom, hayom shlosha shavuos ba'omer.

89
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:26,065
It means at the end of the shavua, means
the seventh, the fourteenth, twenty-first,

90
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,303
the twenty-eighth, and so forth.

91
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:36,876
When I obtain a shavua,

92
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,945
a total shavua I mean.

93
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,880
Fractions, I mean, don't count.

94
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,915
This a machlokes haRishonim.

95
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:48,955
This was quite a,

96
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:59,365
you can simply divide the
Rishonim into two groups.

97
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,606
So, many Rishonim require the
mention of shavuos every night.

98
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,577
Many Rishonim say every night
makes no sense...the mention of

99
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,214
shavuos at the conclusion of the

100
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,383
week, of the days.

101
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,819
[Comment from Audience -- Multiples
of seven.] What you say?

102
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,788
[Comment from Audience -- Multiples
of seven.] Yes, sure ... sure.

103
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,959
Now.

104
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,195
One.

105
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,831
What is next?

106
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:42,241
Interesting is, interesting is, no, no,
no, no, interesting is something else.

107
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,311
The Rambam in Sefer

108
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,882
Hamitzvos, the Rambam in Mishneh
Torah, we don't know anything.

109
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:55,154
The shavuos, I mean is very short
and very brief, it's very hard

110
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,823
to get to some conclusions as

111
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,261
far as the controversy is concerned.

112
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:09,101
But the Rambam, the Rambam
in explaining, in explaining

113
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:18,878
his method as far as minyan hamitzvos
is concerned, 

114
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:26,952
the question was, the

115
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:35,094
question which rose before the Rambam
is whether to count shavuos and yomim

116
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:43,736
as two mitzvos, or count yomim as one
mitzva which includes shavuos as well.

117
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,005
The Rambam has in Sefer Hamitzvos.

118
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,342
So the Rambam says no, shavuos should
not be counted as separate mitzvah,

119
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,878
shouldn't be counted as separate mitzvah.

120
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:59,051
Shavuos should be counted as, while
yomim ushvuos are one mitzvah.

121
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,621
Because it's not a mitzvah for
two minyanim, but the mitzvah is

122
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:15,501
to count yomim and organize them into

123
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,003
units, and each unit is

124
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,874
what? Is the shavua.

125
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:26,846
It means when I count Hayom ... arba'a
asar yom sheheim shnei shavuos

126
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:36,756
ba'omer, I shouldn't look upon this
as a separate count, ... shnei yomim

127
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,690
and then arba'a

128
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,893
asar yom and then acount of shnei shavuos.

129
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:45,998
The shnei shavuos is actually
included in the minyan hayomim.

130
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,569
I have got to count yomim and
then immediately organize the

131
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,506
yomim into units of shavuos.

132
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:59,211
But shavua is a prat, so to
say ..., it is an expression

133
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,815
actually of the minyan hayomim.

134
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,950
Interesting is that

135
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:13,726
actually in the Torah,
is the shavua emphasized.

136
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,497
Shiva shavuos tispor lach
mehachel chermeish bakomoh

137
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,967
tachel lispor shiva shavuos.

138
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,335
Shiva shavuos tispor lach.

139
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,905
And then Chag Shavuos.

140
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,376
But the Rambam was

141
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:35,347
almost insists, apparently, but the

142
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,926
But the Rambam considers the minyan hayomimas the main, 

143
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,829
as the most important

144
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:54,567
minyan, while shavuos is just a
qualification in minyan hayomim.

145
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,535
You see, I can count a dollar.

146
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:03,976
I count a dollar, the way it
is integrated from pennies.

147
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:13,419
But it is not, 
the minyan of the pennies

148
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,192
includes, then when I get to the dollar,

149
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:27,499
so the pennies are organized into units,
into entities, but there is only a

150
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,236
kiyum of yomim, not a kiyum of shavuos.

151
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,004
How does the Rambam know that?

152
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:44,750
He says ... our minhag is to, and the

153
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,454
Rambam, the following controversy, whether

154
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,162
the minyan of Omer

155
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,733
is consists of

156
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:06,572
yomim, whether minyan haOmer, this
controversy, should every night I have

157
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,442
got to mention the minyan hashavuos,
or minyan hashavuos enough for me

158
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:17,082
that I mention it once a week, is this
depends upon the problem whether yomim

159
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,553
ushvuos are one mitzvah or two mitzvos.

160
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,589
Because if there are two
mitzvos, you have got

161
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,627
to mention the shavua every
night, that's exactly what we do.

162
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:40,472
But however, if it is one mitzvah,
yomim is just a qualification I mean

163
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,245
... shavua is a qualification as far as

164
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,846
yomim are concerned.

165
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:53,352
And if it's a qualification it's
only at the end of the shavua,

166
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,687
not in the middle of the shavua.

167
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,855
You have, no one has [inaudible].

168
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,458
But actually

169
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,930
we don't understand the Rambam.

170
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,332
What is the proof?

171
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,138
It might be for instance we mention
shavuos every night, it's our minhag,

172
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:18,077
but we might agree with all the
opinions, with the opinions of the

173
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:24,049
Rishonim, that the mitzvah is not
shavuos and the mitzvah is yomim.

174
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,719
And then the Rambam says something else.

175
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:31,523
Had the mitzvah been shavuos as
well as yomim, you would say,

176
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:36,762
you would count Omer, you would
count Omer with two brachos.

177
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:41,133
Limnos chamishim yom 
and minyan shiva shavuos.

178
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:47,873
The fact that we don't count yomim
and shvuos with two brachos, but

179
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:54,747
with one bracha, is apparently
that the kiyum hamitzvah consists

180
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,082
exclusively in the yomim.

181
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,484
The shavuos is just

182
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,160
a kiyum in the yomim.

183
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,864
The yom should not be left just 45 days.

184
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,601
If you count 45 days, you
have to explain, I mean,

185
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,371
what do 45 days mean in term of shavuos.

186
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,875
The next unit is shavua to yomim.

187
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,044
This is, this is the Rambam.

188
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,813
Now next, what's next?

189
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:29,481
Huh?

190
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,718
[Answer from audience.] I don't hear you.

191
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:42,428
You mean the Tosfos that Sefiras

192
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:48,867
HaOmer is good before bein hashmashos,
not only good, but Tosfos recommends that

193
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,003
it be counted before bein hashmashos.

194
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,573
Not only it's good, ... mitzvah,
that's because of temimos.

195
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,579
Nu, and many Rishonim disagree,
many Rishonim say that, that

196
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,249
Sefiras HaOmer requires laylah.

197
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,217
Bein hashmashos

198
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,518
is not good enough;

199
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,188
we need laylah.

200
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,659
I mean, our minhag is to wait
on days on which we count

201
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,797
sefirah for tzeis hakochavim,
not to count sefirah immediately

202
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:24,136
with shkias hachamah.

203
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,972
Alright, why does Tosfos say?

204
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,742
Because it is temimos.

205
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,044
Temimos.

206
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,750
Tosfos [inaudible] is kasher
bein hashmashos, [Inaudible]

207
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,120
we always knew that if he

208
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,992
counts before bein hashmashos, the
counting during bein hashmashos,

209
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:53,298
then to postpone it until after
bein hashmashos because of temimos.

210
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,068
Is this,

211
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,672
what did Tosfos understand by temimos?

212
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:09,781
For instance, the problem of, the
Halachos Gedolos' problem, shochach,

213
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:15,587
he forgot, there I understand what
temimos means, because if I skipped

214
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,524
one sefirah is there is no minyan.

215
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,059
Sefirah is a series,

216
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,295
[inaudible] sefirah.

217
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:32,638
And if I cannot get, if I have
lost the third day, I cannot get

218
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,173
from the second to the fourth.

219
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,111
This is temimos, temimos in the
maaseh sefirah, temimos we understand.

220
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,748
It is that the minyan be a tamim, the

221
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,950
minyan be a continuously total minyan.

222
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,318
That I understand.

223
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,787
But Tosfos'

224
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:54,660
temimos is a different kind of temimos.

225
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,962
It's not in the minyan, the
minyan is correct anyway.

226
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,433
I count one, two, three,
four, five every night,

227
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,804
every night

228
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,208
I mean, bein hashmashos.

229
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,912
Is the minyan, the minyan
there is temimos in the minyan.

230
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:19,518
So what is Tosfos, how does Tosfos
utilize the bein hashmashos ... temimos

231
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,520
with regard to bein hashmashos?

232
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,222
Why is it not temimos?

233
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,624
You understand me?

234
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,461
Temimos means simple.

235
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:36,335
If I want to get to 49, I cannot get
to 49 unless all sfiros are counted.

236
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,136
Every day is counted with sefirah.

237
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:46,612
So gradually I get to the
sefirah of 49, the last sefirah.

238
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,547
That I understand.

239
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:55,153
But as I told you, in counting, if
you don't count 10, you counted 9,

240
00:20:55,153 --> 00:21:00,092
you skipped 10, you want to count
11, so we'll tell him you're a liar,

241
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,128
because you yourself did not count 10.

242
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,863
It is 9 and 11.

243
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,165
You understand, that 9
and 11 is not a sefirah.

244
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,236
If it's not a sefirah, you cannot count
the sefirah... You need counting.

245
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,941
If I count 10 dollars, I want all the
10 dollars be placed on the table in

246
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,811
my, I could account for the 10 dollars.

247
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,614
So then it is sefirah.

248
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:28,520
But if I cannot account for the 10
dollars, I can account for 8 and 1, the 9

249
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,490
is missing, is not sefirah, then wonderful.

250
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,693
But this is not Tosfos.

251
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,429
Therefore I have got to
count bein hashmashos?

252
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,299
Why, therefore I have to
count bein hashmashos?

253
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,134
Huh?

254
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,772
[Answer from audience]
What do you mean each one?

255
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,439
Huh?

256
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,941
[Answers from audience] Yeah.

257
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:55,047
[Answers from audience] Not
zerizin makdimin lemitzvos,

258
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,717
not zerizim makdimin lemitzvos.

259
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,586
Zerizim makdimin lemitzvos
is a different thought.

260
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,655
I don't say zerizim makdimin

261
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,990
lemitzvos are not involved.

262
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,491
It's a different thought.

263
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,095
Be'emes, the Gemara [inaudible] Tosfos.

264
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:17,069
The Gemara says, yachol
yiktzor balaylah veyavi beyom.

265
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,171
The Gemara

266
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:25,811
Apparently it's very hard even
to express, to define that

267
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:35,721
the day should be, is
supposed to be counted.

268
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,091
The whole day has got to be counted.

269
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,294
The day has got to be a manuy.

270
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,032
The day has got to be a manuy.

271
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,905
In Rambam also, the Rambam
says, vesofrim balaylah.

272
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,075
Vesofrim balaylah.

273
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,547
Ve'im lo safar balaylah
vesafar beyom ... yatza.

274
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,955
The sofer balaylah, this is
not in the maaseh sefirah.

275
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,525
This is in the, I cannot
actually formulate it,

276
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:23,168
but it is in the chalos shem that
the 49 days from Shavuos to, from

277
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:27,372
Pesach to Shavuos should be menuyim.

278
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,643
And the earlier, the better.

279
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,015
The earlier is better.

280
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:42,087
...it is balaylah who needs bayom.

281
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,022
This is the Gemara.

282
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:50,362
But the Tosfos says, even balaylah itself,
you can push it up to bein hashmashos, 

283
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,164
is certainly good.

284
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:58,804
That there is halacha of temimos,
not only with regard to the maaseh

285
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:04,042
sefirah, but there is a halacha of
temimos also with regard to the chalos

286
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:10,382
shem yom manuy yom menuy,
this is the Gemara.

287
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,020
The difference between the Tosfos
and the Gemara is, consists in what?

288
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,254
The difference.

289
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:20,892
The Gemara says it, and therefore
one should not wait with Sefiras

290
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:26,198
HaOmer until the night, until
the day, but he has got to count

291
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,801
immediately, I mean, during the time

292
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:35,707
of, during the night, he
has got to, not to wait.

293
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:45,350
...yachol yiktzor bayom veyimneh balaylah?

294
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,451
The Gemara temimos

295
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,819
beinan veleka.

296
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,422
And if he'll count when?

297
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,126
The day, there is no temimos.

298
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,796
Because what will be missing?

299
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,534
[Answer from audience] The part
of the yom, namely, the laylah.

300
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,268
Correct.

301
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,769
It will be missing.

302
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,904
That's what the Gemara says.

303
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:11,176
Tosfos says, the same logic,
Tosfos says, you can extend it.

304
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,180
Haschalas halaylah rather than in

305
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,649
the morning hours.

306
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:24,222
If I can count sefirah today,
...8:00, after 7:00, or 7:00,

307
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,895
as soon as possible, even bein
hashmashos, this is more temimos.

308
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:37,002
Somehow, the kiyum from temimos is
achieved  

309
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,573
 in ... almost a perfect manner

310
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,877
Namely, I include the
night and the day in what?

311
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:54,886
The night and the day in the 49 days,
in the menuyim, in the yomim menuyim.

312
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,557
You can argue with the Baalei HaTosfos.

313
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,594
[Comments from audience]

314
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,962
Again?

315
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,368
[Comments from audience]

316
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:20,345
You may argue with the Baalei HaTosfos.

317
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,846
Please.

318
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:30,488
[Question from audience.] Just a moment,
it's a good question that you have.

319
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:43,969
I may disagree with the Baalei
HaTosfos and say laylah vayom is

320
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:51,076
two different zmanim, two different
entities of time, time entities.

321
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,877
There is laylah and yom.

322
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,015
And the sefirah has got to
include those two entities.

323
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,318
So that's why you cannot
postpone the sefirah

324
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,393
until dawn until amud hashachar,
but you have to count at night, but

325
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:13,698
when you count at night, there is
no difference whether you count at

326
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:19,270
haschalas halaylah or you count not
at haschalas halaylah but you count

327
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,942
betzeis halayah at the end of the night.

328
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:30,248
If the night is missing,
then it's not temimos.

329
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:34,519
But if the night is not missing,
not missing at all,

330
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:45,497
he'll count at night, but the night for
him will consist of the five last hours,

331
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,868
he'll count sefirah

332
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:55,573
at 4:00 in the morning, but the
sefirah will consist of both

333
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,708
zmanim, namely what?

334
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,310
[The audience answers -- Laylah
and yom.] This itself is enough.

335
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,646
Take a look at Rambam.

336
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,181
Take a look at Rambam, the Rambam says.

337
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,050
You have a Rambam?

338
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:11,923
Somebody have a... [Audience
member reads the Rambam]

339
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,628
...Mitchilas hayomim monin.

340
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,664
It is at the beginning of

341
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,466
the day that you have to count sefirah.

342
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,101
This is the halacha from temimos.

343
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:28,640
And therefore I do count at
night not in the daytime.

344
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:42,520
The night with regard to sefirah, the fact

345
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,488
that we have to

346
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:49,894
count at night is not because
sefirah is a mitzvah mierev balaylah.

347
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,931
But for a different reason.

348
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,299
Namely, what reason?

349
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,901
Because it's temimos.

350
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,604
When do I lose temimos?

351
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:04,743
When do I succeed in achieving temimos?

352
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,313
If the

353
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:13,618
sefirah takes place balaylah
regardless as to the hour, but

354
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:20,725
there are five minutes before amud
hashachar I can still count sefirah,

355
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:27,098
and actually and have a
sefirah consisting of temimos.

356
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,436
However if I counted

357
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:41,446
sefirah after the night has passed, then
there is no sefirah because the cheilek

358
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,316
hayom which we call laylah is missing.

359
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,651
That's what you have to say.

360
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,087
But anyway it's a machlokes haRishonim.

361
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,855
What's next?

362
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,991
What's next?

363
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,060
I can't hear.

364
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,364
Shomea ke’oneh?

365
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:07,438
It was raised by the Rashba and the Magen
Avraham quotes him, but I don't believe

366
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:12,610
it was a very publicized controversy.

367
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,046
What?

368
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:21,452
[Answer from audience.] ...I don't
know about the controversy about...

369
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,422
oh, you mean the Ramban's shitah that,

370
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:33,131
Ramban's shitah as Friday you count,
you, oh, the Rashi shitah at night.

371
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,135
Rashi doesn't say it actually.

372
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,840
The [inaudible] explains the
Rashi's shitah, but you cannot,

373
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,176
we don't know exactly what Rashi says.

374
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:51,816
Rashi says Rashi went into beis
medrash and they were in the process

375
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:57,255
of counting sefirah, so Rashi counted
sefirah with them with a bracha.

376
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,961
Because Rashi's shitah 
is that it was that you

377
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:08,066
may count sefirah bein hashmashos, this
in itself wouldn't have been a sensation.

378
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:18,543
But Rashi explained, if I should remind
myself too late in the night, that I

379
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:26,351
did not count sefirah bizmano, in its
proper time, so I'll repeat the count.

380
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,755
And if

381
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:40,031
I will not, I will forget to count
sefirah later at night before I

382
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,101
retire, I'll accomplish at least,

383
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:51,342
I'll accomplish the what, what
will I accomplish if I want to,

384
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:56,581
that mikol makom lo yafsid minyano,
I will not lose the minyan.

385
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,685
It means according to Rashi like that.

386
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,691
Sefirah requires shkiyas
hachama, bein hashmashos.

387
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:14,599
But this is only with regard
to the fulfillment of my duty.

388
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:29,380
Namely, that the mitzvah Sefiras
HaOmer, ... he counted with the minyan,

389
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:36,254
with the tzibbur, without a bracha.

390
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:42,293
He counted with the tzibbur, counted
with the tzibbur without a bracha.

391
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,998
Just a moment, how did Rashi say it?

392
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:52,370
[Answers from audience.]
Rashi did not say at night.

393
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,739
Night was my pshat.

394
00:32:55,306 --> 00:33:00,478
[Comments from audience.] He
counts [answers from audience.]

395
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:06,484
Alright, in the first time without a
bracha... Yes, the second time I know.

396
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,288
According to Rashi,

397
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:14,759
the way Rashi is like this: haya
nichnas im hatzibbur, vehaya

398
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,227
moneh im hatzibbur belo bracha.

399
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:24,068
And later he used to repeat this
sefirah before retiring, before

400
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:29,240
retiring, but later, before
retiring, he made the bracha... So,

401
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,912
why did he count the sefirah prior to

402
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,381
that with the tzibbur?

403
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,982
What will he accomplish?

404
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,817
He says like that

405
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:46,057
in case I should forget,
I would not lose my count.

406
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,526
That’s Rashi.

407
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,995
So the Rishonim ask, ma nafshach?

408
00:33:50,995 --> 00:34:04,976
If he counts later before retiring,
he counts without a bracha, ... the

409
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,177
second time with a bracha.

410
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,779
Yes.

411
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,614
The second time with a bracha.

412
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,783
The first time without a bracha.

413
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,186
So why does he say that it

414
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:19,657
will help him to protect him
against losing, losing the

415
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:24,162
entire mitzva of sefirah?

416
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:29,434
If he made a bracha the second
time, apparently the sefirah

417
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,971
the first time is not good.

418
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:41,079
If the sefirah is not valid
the first time, he should lose

419
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,682
the possibility, he should lose

420
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,085
the opportunity of sefirah

421
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:54,492
the second time if he forgot to
repeat, even though the bracha,

422
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,462
...even though he counted sefira

423
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,297
with the tzibbur, correct?

424
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,465
Yeah.

425
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,136
I'll discuss it.

426
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,904
I didn't have it in mind, this.

427
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:08,739
Pashut!

428
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,777
The machlokes the Behag and the
Rabbeinu Tam if he has forgotten

429
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:19,951
one day whether he continues to
count with a bracha or he has got to

430
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,854
discontinue the count with a bracha.

431
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,625
I mean the famous shittas Rabbeinu
Tam, the famous shittas Rabbeinu Tam,

432
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:33,064
I mean of Behag, hashochach
v'lo safar paam echas, harei ze sofer

433
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:36,467
beli ... bracha ... eino sofer klal.

434
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,871
This is a big machlokes between the

435
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,473
Rabbeinu Tam and the Behag

436
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:50,548
whether shochach v'lo safar balaylah,
shochach v'lo safar, whether he may

437
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,551
continue to count with a bracha or not.

438
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:58,589
What else? [Answer from audience.] 

439
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,827
 Yeah, but it's not a public machlokes. 

440
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:10,768
This is the Rashba in the name 
of other Rishonim.

441
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:17,175
Then ... shochach v'lo safar
balaylah what's about whether

442
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,311
he may say a bracha bayom?

443
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:27,618
If I did forget to count, is a
machlokes again, the Rabbeinu Tam

444
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:34,592
says that I cannot count with a bracha
because the laylah is not zman Sefiras Haomer.

445
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,664
The yom is not zman sefirah.

446
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,499
But many Rishonim, the

447
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,267
Rambam, shochach velo

448
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:49,507
mana balaylah, moneh bayom b'ivracha.

449
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:53,878
...the Rambam's shitah, moneh
bayom, bayom, when the Rambam says

450
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,014
moneh bayom means with a bracha.

451
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:02,353
Those are the basic controversies.

452
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,087
Yes.

453
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,590
So let's take one by one.

454
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,927
The controversy whether there is
minyan hashavuos, whether there is

455
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:15,132
minyan hashavuos every night, or minyan hashavuos

456
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,901
is limited only to

457
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:25,743
to the night on which the shavua, the
sefirah is completed, as far as the shavua

458
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,780
is concerned, every, yeah, multiples.

459
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,483
this is the machlokes haRishonim exactly.

460
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:43,661
The Tur quotes, the Tur, the
Chinuch ... This is number one.

461
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,632
Next is the machlokes, whether what?

462
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,966
Deroaysa derabanan.

463
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,669
The Rambam's shitah sefirah
bizman hazeh is what?

464
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,170
Deoraysa.

465
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,075
All the Rishonim, the
gemara, Ameimar mana yomei

466
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:02,413
velo mana shvuei amar zecher lemikdash.

467
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,681
Zecher lemikdash.

468
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:08,119
Is the gemara I mean apparently
considers mitzvas sefirah bezman

469
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,288
hazeh a derabanan, derabanan.

470
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:17,228
And then the two problems, whether sefirah
bayom is kasher, and the second problem is

471
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:27,972
whether in case of forgetting this
sefirah, whether he may continue

472
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:32,543
with the minyan or he cannot continue
with the minyan, with the tzibbur.

473
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,812
This is again a machlokes haRishonim.

474
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:41,585
Now the, let me say the following.

475
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:52,797
When the Behag says, you see, when
the mechaber says, shochach velo

476
00:38:52,797 --> 00:39:01,739
mana balaylah moneh bayom beli
bracha, when I say it, it's correct.

477
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,642
I'll say shochach,

478
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:14,885
if I forgot to count the sefirah
at night, and I counted in

479
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,022
the daytime, I don't say a bracha.

480
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,324
Why don't I say a bracha, why?

481
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,426
[Answer from audience
-- Chaser the laylah.

482
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,829
So don't count at all?

483
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,866
Don't count at all.

484
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,202
[Answer from audience -- Legabei
temimos it counts.]

485
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,172
 The answer is, when he says 
it it's all right, 

486
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:41,045
because when he say it, what does
it express belo bracha?

487
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,913
We don't know the halacha.

488
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:47,051
Since we don't know the halacha, we
know two Rishonim have disagreed,

489
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:52,356
namely the Behag and Rabbeinu Tam,
or the Rambam and the Rabbeinu Tam,

490
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:56,460
whether sefirah is valid in the daytime.

491
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,801
So in such a machlokes, in such a
case which Rishonim have, I mean,

492
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:09,373
have argued with each other and
their opinions are diametrically 

493
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:14,612
opposed to each other, so he is
moneh belo bracha, like all sfeikos.

494
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,648
A sfeika d'oraysa
l'chumra, what do you do?

495
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,583
You are moneh belo bracha.

496
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,119
But the Behag cannot say that.

497
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,991
The Behag cannot say, lo mana
balaylah moneh bayom belo bracha.

498
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,993
It will be ridiculous.

499
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:36,100
You ask the Behag, I mean to tell
us the following, what is it?

500
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:47,912
 Is the yom kosher lisfiras haomer or the yom I mean the sefirah bayom is not valid? 

501
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,382
 Unless the Behag will say he doesn't know, 

502
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,651
so we'll say belo bracha.

503
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,188
But I hope the Behag
wouldn't say he doesn't know.

504
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:01,492
So it means the Behag will
say it's good, bayom is good.

505
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,094
If bayom is good, why not a bracha?

506
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:18,209
We have a text, which, shochach
velo mana balaylah, moneh bayom, you

507
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:25,015
cannot say belo bracha, [inaudible].

508
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,116
So not a question of a

509
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:32,022
Behag is not a question of two shittos
in Mishnah Berurah, you understand?

510
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:38,095
The Behag said moneh bayom,
he couldn't say bracha.

511
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,031
Either moneh bayom or eino moneh bayom.

512
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,636
 Brachos is completely, the 
Ramban cannot say ...

513
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,340
 the mitzva and he, 

514
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,443
 without a bracha. 
Why without a bracha? 

515
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,146
 Unless the Behag will say that he has a safek, he has a doubt in mind. 

516
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,315
 Very difficult. Yeah. 

517
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:03,821
Tosfos in Megillah does have
the phrase, "Kosav HaBehag,

518
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:16,367
veheicha delo mana balaya,
moneh bayom belo bracha.

519
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,906
...the Gemara in Megillah you can find it.

520
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,541
Tosfos in Megillah quote,

521
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,175
might be, it might

522
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:28,178
have been a shigra d'lishna.

523
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,447
A shigrah d'lishna.

524
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:38,622
Because Tosfos in such cases he is
used to the expression belo bracha.

525
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,891
...kosav Behag

526
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,396
...It's a shigra d'lishna.

527
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,566
But anyway Tosfos should
have said, veheicha

528
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:54,238
delo mana balaylah moneh
bayom, kosav Behag.

529
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,409
So somehow it's a shigra d'lishna
or it's a taus sofer, I don't know.

530
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:07,217
But if one should be obstinate, be very
stubborn, and point out the text in

531
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:18,195
Tosfos, moneh bayom belo bracha, as a
quotation from the Behag, as a quotation

532
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:23,667
from the Behag, is then is, you have

533
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:31,108
only one way, one approach to this
Behag, one way how to understand.

534
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,449
Apparently if we should,
you have a Gemara Megillah?

535
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:42,219
...U'Behag kosav deheicha
deinshi levarech balaylah

536
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,588
heicha deinshi shochach

537
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:49,627
levarech balayla, to count
Sefiras HaOmer balaylah

538
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,795
yimneh lemachar belo bracha.

539
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,898
yimneh lemachar belo bracha.

540
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,734
Vechein halacha.

541
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:03,073
Aval im shachach laylah vayom lo yimneh
od bivracha debeinan temimos veleka.

542
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,776
What do you say?

543
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,747
Aval im shachach laylah vayom lo yimneh.

544
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,583
He skipped it, completely, yes?

545
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,586
Debeinan temimos veleka.

546
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,856
So what is the aval,
what is the aval here?

547
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:29,099
[Answer from audience.] Tosfos says
the Behag had said two halachos.

548
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:35,673
One halacha is moneh bayom belo
bracha, and the second halacha what is?

549
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,775
What is?

550
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,044
It's not even a bracha.

551
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,545
Not even belo bracha.

552
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,215
In both cases.

553
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:48,585
Lo yimneh od b'vracha
debeinan temimos veleka.

554
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:49,319
[Inaudible].

555
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,854
Lo yimneh od bivracha.

556
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:59,663
So why does the Behag say
lo yimneh od belo bracha.

557
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:09,073
And Tosfos also quotes him, that shochach
balaylah moneh bayom, why belo bracha?

558
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,744
It is good, say a bracha.

559
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,846
You think that

560
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,248
sefirah balaylah is kosher, say a bracha.

561
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,185
You don't think so, so you
don't have to say anything.

562
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,322
What do you see from this Behag?

563
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,459
What do you infer from this Behag immediately?

564
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,662
If the, again, in my
opinion it's a taus sofer.

565
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,232
But anyway, Tosfos quotes the Behag.

566
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,902
Probably even the text in
Behag is impossible to see,

567
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,239
to ascertain the proper text.

568
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,640
It's impossible.

569
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:48,345
There are so many editions by the
Behag, and the more editions they

570
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,848
have the more complicated it becomes.

571
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:57,654
But however if the Tosfos'
quotation in Behag is correct,

572
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,826
so apparently the Behag is of the

573
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:09,366
opinion there are two
minyanim in Sefiras HaOmer.

574
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,702
Two minyanim.

575
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:18,342
One minyan, and with regard to one, two
kiyumim in Sefiras HaOmer, two kiyumim.

576
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:27,785
And if it's two kiyumim, is if mana
balaylah in the proper time, he

577
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:35,092
makes a bracha because he's mekayem,
he fulfills both, the mitzvas

578
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:38,996
Sefiras HaOmer at both levels.

579
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,131
We'll see soon what it is.

580
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,070
But however, if balaylah he didn't
do that, he does it bayom, he does

581
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,007
it bayom, his one kiyum is missing.

582
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:54,311
He still retains another kiyum.

583
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,749
But the other kiyum
does not require bracha.

584
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:07,925
I mean in simple words, first of
all, Sefiras HaOmer be'emes has two

585
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:13,664
parshas, has one parsha in Emor:

586
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:18,602
U'sfartem lachem mimochoras haShabbos
miyom haviachem es omer hatnufah sheva

587
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:25,075
shabbasos temimos tiheyenah... mimochoras
haShabbos hashvi'is tisperu chamishim yom.

588
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:31,315
[Inaudible] the first one...this
is number one, a mitzva.

589
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:36,220
And then in Re'eh: chag sispor
lach mehachel chermeish bakomoh.

590
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:49,366
And then is apparently is the kvius,
the kvius from Shavuos, Shavuos lanikba

591
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,135
depends upon the 
yom hachamishim, correct?

592
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,675
Shavuos differs from other yomim tovim.

593
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:10,420
(Inaudible). Atzeres peamim hey, peamim vav, peamim zayin.

594
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:16,193
We because we have a stable calendar,
it's always vav, always vav.

595
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:23,567
We fix ... But bizman hareiyah, Beis
Din could designate Atzeres on any

596
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,169
of three days.

597
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:32,142
This is the parsha, this is
the parsha in Re'eh.

598
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:37,347
Chag Shavuos tispor lach sheva
shavuos tispor lach mehachel chermeish

599
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,284
bakomoh tachel lispor shiva shavuos.

600
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,287
Va'asisem chag shavuos lashem...

601
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,495
The shvuos does not depend upon the

602
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:58,802
date in the month, the monthly days, but
depends upon the 50th of Sefiras HaOmer.

603
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:04,675
Is memaila, is the sefirah
is kovea the Chag Shavuos.

604
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:09,513
The sefirah is kovea the Chag Shavuos.

605
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:21,925
...there is another kiyum from
sefiras arba'aim vetisha yomim in

606
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:26,596
order to establish the Chag Shavuos.

607
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:31,969
If it's a mitzva to establish all moadei
Hashem, vayedaber Moshe es moadei Hashem

608
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:38,241
el bnei Yisrael, it's also pertinent
to establish the yom tov of Shavuos.

609
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:46,249
The yom tov of Shavuos is
established by counting Sefiras HaOmer.

610
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,721
The Behag’s shitah is like that.

611
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:58,829
Let's say for instance,
shochach velo mana,

612
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,900
the Behag says yimneh
bayom belo bracha, correct?

613
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,203
The Tosfos quotes the Behag.

614
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,873
So they ask why belo bracha?

615
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,808
He doesn't have to count at all.

616
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,377
No.

617
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:21,518
The halacha in the kvius
for Shavuos, we don't care.

618
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:26,890
Or take the other case, the case
of shochach velo mana balaylah,

619
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,694
whether moneh bayom, is be'emes is

620
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:39,669
with regard to the kiyum
Sefiras HaOmer per se, it's

621
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,505
only made balaylah, not beyom.

622
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:46,276
But if you take Sefiras

623
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:54,885
HaOmer and you analyze it, I
mean from the viewpoint of what?

624
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:59,256
 [Answer from audience.] Is Chag Shavuos, which means bayom is also good.

625
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:06,530
As far as Chag Shavuos is concerned,
there is yom and laylah, but they are not

626
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,198
two aristocrats...,

627
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,000
there is no conflict.

628
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:16,273
With regard to the mitzvas
sefirah, is laylah the halacha,

629
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:20,243
because it's like ktziras haomer,
that's what the Gemara says.

630
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,947
With regard to the mitzvas
sefirah, the general mitzvas

631
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:28,452
sefirah is laylah according to Behag.

632
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:33,557
Is laylah, no, is yom no
good but you need what?

633
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:34,825
Laylah.

634
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:39,396
Is memeila there is no bracha
because bracha is associated

635
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:43,100
with the mitzva ofSefiras HaOmer.

636
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:52,676
But as far, but if, but however as far as the kvius of Shavuos is concerned,

637
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:56,746
 is yom also good.

638
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,915
Because the kvius is the same.

639
00:51:58,915 --> 00:51:59,749
There's not

640
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:06,089
a single difference between yom and
laylah as far as the kvius Shavuos

641
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,491
is concerned.

642
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,193
[Question from Audience: Why can you make
a bracha the next night?] [Inaudible].

643
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:15,365
He cannot make according
to Behag. Just a moment.

644
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,667
Just a moment.

645
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:26,710
If the Behag is two kiyumim, he's
moneh bayom what is he missing,

646
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,345
he misses something bayom.

647
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,047
What does he miss bayom?

648
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,950
The kiyum from Sefiras HaOmer
al kol yachid veyachid.

649
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,052
This is number one.

650
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,355
On the other hand, he
still does another kiyum.

651
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,556
What is the kiyum?

652
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,461
From the kvius Chag Shavuos, vayedaber
Moshe es moadei Hashem el bnei Yisrael.

653
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,230
the kvius from Chag Shavuos.

654
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:54,437
As far as the kvius from Chag HaShavuos
is concerned, the same validity he

655
00:52:54,437 --> 00:53:04,748
ascribed to the sefiras haomer balaylah,
the same importance can be ascribed

656
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:13,523
attributed to sefiras haomer bayom as
far as the kvius moadim is concerned, as

657
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:19,362
far as the Chag Shavuos ta'aseh lecha.

658
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:25,802
But the bracha, the bracha,
the tikkun habracha was on

659
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:29,339
the kiyum kol yachid veyachid, Sefiras HaOmer.

660
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:35,078
Because why is Sefiras
HaOmer no good bayom,

661
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:42,219
is because it is equated with
ktzira, and ktzira is balaylah.

662
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,423
It's only with regard to the
mitzvas sefiras haomer which

663
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,891
has nothing to do with kvius.

664
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:52,462
But the mitzvas sefiras
haomer with kvius is good

665
00:53:52,462 --> 00:54:01,004
bayom and balaylah, because as far as
the dates are concerned, is the sefiras

666
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:09,846
haomer bayom, the sefiras haomer bayom
just as good and just as correct balaylah.

667
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,014
This is number one.

668
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:19,556
He asks the question, why if shochach the

669
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:23,593
Behag also said belo bracha,
why there belo bracha?

670
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,694
Mima nafshach.

671
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:29,733
If the Behag, same kashya, if the
Behag is of the opinion that you need

672
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,003
temimos, so he shouldn't count at all.

673
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,072
If the Behag is of the
opinion that temimos

674
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:49,786
is not, the requirement of temimos is,
I don't have to give up sefiras haomer

675
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:55,425
because I missed the minyan, so why?

676
00:54:55,425 --> 00:55:01,097
The question what he asked is bayom
and balaylah I understand very well

677
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:09,873
that the kvius bayom takes in, ... Chag
Shavuos, is the kvius hayom is good.

678
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,312
But however, not the Chag Shavuos,
the kvius Chag Shavuos, but

679
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:21,117
the mitzva of sefirah per se, is no
good in sefiras haomer.

680
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:27,257
The Sefiras HaOmer of kol yachid
veyachid, is memaila, is the bracha,

681
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:31,761
the question is which aspect of
the mitzva requires a bracha.

682
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:36,566
Many mitzvos have...one
aspect...Al Biur chametz.

683
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,369
Al biur chametz consists of
searching the chametz, finding the

684
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,705
chametz and destroying the chametz.

685
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,873
The bracha what do you say the bracha?

686
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,542
[Answer from audience.] Over searching.

687
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:49,279
The question in sefirah is,
what do you say the bracha?

688
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,448
Over what do you say the bracha?

689
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,150
Over the kiyum for yachid,

690
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:59,789
mimochoras haShabbos hashvi'is tisperu chamishim yom,

691
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:06,162
chamishim yom, or you say the bracha over the kvius ... Shavuos.

692
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,232
Is this is in laylah and yom.

693
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,701
Laylah and yom says Shavuos is good bayom.

694
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:21,211
 While Shavuos, the kvius Shavuos is good bayom

695
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:25,115
but there is no bracha.

696
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:34,824
Memeila is shochach velo mana
balaylah he's moneh bayom without the

697
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:40,797
bracha, because one aspect he complies
with, but he does not fulfill the second

698
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,933
aspect, the aspect of kvius of what?

699
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:44,968
Of shavuos.

700
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,035
Correct.

701
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:55,145
In temimos in shochach, the question was
raised by him, is a similar situation.

702
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:01,718
If it is in kvius, if it is in kvius, is

703
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:11,828
shochach, the halacha, if shochach
velo manah bayom, if shochach

704
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:19,102
velo mana yom min hayomim is
kovea, yes, yes, correct, correct.

705
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:31,981
The halacha is, the halacha is that once
he skipped one night, so there is no what?

706
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,950
There is no temimos...

707
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:41,157
I cannot go on and say hayom
asarah yomim if I skipped yesterday

708
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,559
hayom tisha yomim, correct?

709
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:51,701
...However, in kol
yachid veyachid it is so.

710
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:56,873
But as far as kvius Shavuos is concerned,

711
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:05,515
then I am not a kovea as a yachid, as an individual, I am a kovea as what?

712
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:14,958
As a part of the Klal Yisrael. As far as part of the Klal Yisrael, there is continuity.

713
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:20,463
There is no continuity as far as I am
concerned, but as far as the Klal Yisrael

714
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,166
is concerned, there is continuity.

715
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:28,338
 You cannot say listen, you just say hayom asarah yomim,

716
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,006
how do you know that?

717
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,844
So ... he'll tell me,
what will he tell me?

718
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:38,448
I know that because the
tzibbur counted like that.

719
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:43,086
And I base my minyan 
of the minyan hatzibbur.

720
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:51,127
This is good enough, but only to,
it's good enough with regard to what?

721
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,562
To kvius Shavuos.

722
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:59,402
Because kvius Shavuos does not
depend upon the yachid, the

723
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:02,505
tzibbur together is kovea Shavuos.

724
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:10,113
But as far as my duty, my chova
is concerned, my duty, namely to

725
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:16,753
count 50 days, if I missed one
I don't fulfill the mitzvah.

726
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:23,860
The fact that the tzibbur will go on with
the count, is quite helpful if it's a

727
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,462
problem of kvius Shavuos of the tzibbur.

728
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:32,435
But it doesn't help me at all as far
as my private mitzvah is concerned.

729
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:37,907
In a word, shochach velo mana lo
bayom velo balaylah, is the tzibbur

730
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:41,010
kovea together

731
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,012
with the tzibbur.

732
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:50,587
[Question from audience.] I have got,
I've got to count, but no bracha.

733
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,490
The bracha is again, as far
as a yachid is concerned.

734
00:59:55,158 --> 01:00:02,732
In a word, the mitzvas Sefiras
HaOmer has two kiyumim.

735
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:10,873
A kiyum from just sefirah which
leads to nothing, just sefirah.

736
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,810
And a kiyum from kvius Shavuos.

737
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,314
For sheva shavuos tispor lach
mehachel chermesh bakomoh,

738
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,049
tachel lispor shivas shavuos.

739
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,086
Va'asisa chag shavuos laHashem Elokecha.

740
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:33,796
You have it also with regard in

[AUDIO CUTS OUT]

744
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,378
...one function is just sefirah.

745
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,381
The second function of

746
01:00:51,381 --> 01:01:01,457
Sefiras HaOmer is keviah... And that's
the Behag who speaks the language of belo

747
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:06,963
bracha is because the
Behag's both shittos,

748
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:17,473
that bayom is pasul only balaylah
is kasher and the temimos applies

749
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,676
only to the chiyuv of the yachid.

750
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:25,682
As far as the kiyum hamitzvah of kevius
Shavuos which is chal on the klal

751
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:30,586
Yisrael, on beis din, is bayom
and balaylah no different.

752
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:34,424
So if I forgot to count

753
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:40,797
sefirah last night, I reminded myself
bayom, so I say right away about, I count

754
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:47,070
sefirah immediately, as far as Shavuos
is concerned, it's a good sefirah, but

755
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:51,974
he doesn't don't say a bracha because the
bracha is connected, associated with what?

756
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:58,748
With the minyan hayachid, and
this minyan hayachid is missing.

757
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:07,190
[Question from audience.] What what what?

758
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:16,632
[Question from Audience]  

759
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:21,037
The Shulchan Aruch like that.

760
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,439
No no, you are right.

761
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,509
You are right, from a 
viewpoint, you are right.

762
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,778
It's not sfek sfeika.

763
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:34,383
They all are masbir ... count
if I skip the night, but in the

764
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:39,288
daytime I caught ... the sefirah,

765
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,525
is then the next night I can continue.

766
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,460
And they say it's sfek sfeika.

767
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,329
You don't need sfek sfeika.

768
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,865
According to my pshat it
is without sfek sfeika.

769
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:53,703
If I count, he didn't count at night and
I count the daytime, is the sefirah from

770
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:58,074
kvius Yisrael, of chag Shavuos, valid.

771
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:05,148
Is the sefirah valid.

772
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:18,694
The sefirah is valid ... I
didn't count last night

773
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,130
I counted today.

774
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:27,036
Just a moment... What's the case?

775
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,306
What is the case?

776
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:35,578
The case is he forgot to make
a bracha, balaylah he didn't

777
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,181
count so he counts bayom.

778
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:43,186
In the next night he can
go on with a bracha...

779
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,389
So the Shulchan Aruch says it's
because it's a sfek sfeika.

780
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:59,268
Shema bayom is good, ... even if bayom
is, or perhaps, what's the safeik?

781
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:05,541
[Answer from audience.]
Just a moment ... Why

782
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,809
is there sfek sfeika?

783
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:17,053
Shema I'm able to count even if I skipped
... to count in the time ... the mitzvah.

784
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,655
And shema

785
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:31,801
if omitting a sefirah makes it
impossible for me to continue, perhaps

786
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,470
I haven't omitted a sefirah because

787
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,407
I counted bayom, bayom is kasher.

788
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,209
This is the Mechaber.

789
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:49,118
[Question from audience] 

790
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,966
We are interested now 
the way I interpreted

791
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,069
 that I counted the day

792
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:16,445
he counts the day is a kiyum hamitzvah from kvius chag hashavuos,

793
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:23,052
 and if I skipped, that's what the Behag says moneh belo bracha, 

794
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:33,462
minyan is required but a minyan is valid
only vis-a-vis the kvius chag hashavuos,

795
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:36,666
but the minyan has no validity as

796
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:40,836
far as temimos or the chiyuv

797
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,805
hayachid is concerned.

798
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,641
So they say

799
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:50,846
in such a case there
should not be a bracha.

800
01:05:51,480 --> 01:06:02,825
... So because, ... sfek sfeika,
it's a different story.

801
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,996
...if it's not sfek sfeika,
how did I interpret it?

802
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,298
How did I interpret?

803
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:14,837
Not with sfek sfeika, but simply:
Shochach velo mana is moneh belo

804
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:18,074
bracha, but minyan is required.

805
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,776
Why is minyan required?

806
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,314
Kvius Haregel!

807
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:29,218
Then shochach balaylah velo

808
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,420
mana, umana bayom.

809
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:38,661
Again, in bracha is no bracha because
there is no kiyum yachid, but there

810
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:48,871
is a minyan because the minyan has significance.

811
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,107
What's the significance of the minyan?

812
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,175
[Answer from audience.] ...Shavuos.

813
01:06:53,175 --> 01:07:00,349
[Comment from audience.] ...continue.

814
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,351
Just a moment.

815
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,920
Just a moment.

816
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,255
That's why the

817
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:11,727
Mechaber he utilizes sfek sfeika

818
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:15,698
in order to make it possible
for him to say a bracha.

819
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:25,441
The Mechaber says sfeika, the
Mechaber says sfek sfeika.

820
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,443
So the question is,

821
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:33,949
what does the sfek sfeika give us?

822
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:39,622
[Answer from audience.] The inclusion
of the bracha in the next sefirah.

823
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:46,062
Because if not for sfek sfeika, 

824
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:50,900
I would say alright I can continue
count, without a bracha until Shavuos, and

825
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:55,805
Shavuos will be established with the count
without a bracha, even though he skipped.

826
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,742
This ... what you meant.

827
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:18,794
[Question from audience.] 

828
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,964
Please Please.

829
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:25,534
Yeah yeah, go ahead.

830
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:53,462
[Question from Audience.] 

831
01:08:53,462 --> 01:09:09,645
..According to
the Behag... shochach velo mana

832
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:13,082
balaylah moneh bayom belo bracha.

833
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:13,782
Why?

834
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:17,887
Because the kvias tzibbur 
is present here.

835
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,823
But what does he need?

836
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:26,395
But there is no bracha because the
bracha is connected with the yachid.

837
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,831
So how does a

838
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:34,236
yachid regain the privilege of

839
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:36,272
the bracha?

840
01:09:36,272 --> 01:10:01,430
[Comments from audience.]

841
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,034
The way I interpreted, that according

842
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:10,873
to the Behag, the Behag said it
eino yotzei yedei chovaso, or

843
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:15,211
with regard to the chovas Sefiras
HaOmer shel kol yachid veyachid.

844
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,647
As far as the tzibbur is
concerned, the Behag never said it.

845
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:22,484
Is mimeilah, whatever the Behag
said that invalidates this

846
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,587
sefirah, it invalidates only with

847
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:31,327
regard to kiyum alef, to the aspect of
the kiyum from sefiras hayachid.

848
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:36,065
The kiyum from sefiras hatzibbur,
the Behag did not say that the

849
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:47,476
sefirah ...the sefirah is important
because it will be ... kvias hatzibur.

850
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:56,752
[Comment from Audience]
...tzibbur but no bracha.

851
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,121
But not bracha.

852
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:04,760
The Shulchan Aruch says no, he makes
a bracha, the Mechaber says if

853
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,431
you have the combination of two,
sefirah from kol yachid veyachid and

854
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,101
the kvias hatzibbur, there is a bracha.

855
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,604
That's what the Mechaber says, and this

856
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,807
is based upon the sfek sfeika.

857
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:24,179
So, this is sfek sfeika, nu.

858
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:25,481
So what is the kashya?

859
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,017
The Mechaber says it's a sfek sfeika.

860
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:34,590
In Behag it's impossible to
formulate, to see I mean ... the Behag

861
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,960
didn't say sfek sfeika, the
Behag didn't say anything.

862
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:44,133
...Shavuos is nikbah, the kiyum from
yachid is poka, because he missed.

863
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,305
And then what do you do
the rest of the sefirah?

864
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:55,411
I do the rest of the
sefirah...I make no bracha.

865
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:03,152
This is the Mechaber,
because of sfek sfeika.

to count, without a bracha.

876
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,470
We asked why without a bracha.

890
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:09,765
But the continuity...

891
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,952
Alright, let's forget the Rashi.

892
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:35,324
But the Behag, Behag is like that.

893
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:42,064
If he forgot balaylah,
moneh bayom belo bracha.

894
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:47,703
This is shitas Behag, because with
regard to kiyum hayachid, is yom

895
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,839
no good, is only laylah the zman sefirah.

896
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,608
However,

897
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:56,545
the next night, he's moneh bebracha.

898
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,847
Why is moneh bebracha?

899
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,782
Because yes, the

900
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:06,655
next night when he's moneh,
when he counts, he counts

901
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,957
bevracha, for a simple reason.

902
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:23,105
Because, the mitzvas hayachid, in
the mitzvas hayachid, is laylah vayom

903
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,208
play no role in mitzvas hayachid.

904
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:32,347
On the contrary, in mitzvas hayachid
is laylah vayom, in kvius from

905
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:39,021
Beis Din from klal Yisrael is yom
and layalah makes no difference,

906
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,526
yom valayalah makes no difference.

907
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:53,802
But the bracha, there is no bracha
because in yachid it is kasher

908
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:57,205
only balaylah not bayom, not bayom.

909
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:04,479
But when ... the next
sefirah is already a sefirah

910
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:10,285
balaylah, it's a sefirah 
balaylah, there is a bracha.

911
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,889
[Comment from the audience.]

912
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,928
I didn't say each night 
is a separate mitzvah.

913
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,431
I didn't say each night.

914
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:30,672
All I said, if the, please.

915
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:37,646
All I said is if, I asked what does
...yispor belo bebracha what sense does

916
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:40,415
it make as far as the Behag is concerned.

917
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:51,660
If laylah is good and yom
is no good, lo yispor klal.

918
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:58,266
Is yom is good, so yispor bebracha.

919
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:05,574
So we answered, that in the kiyum
from yachid is only balaylah, but

920
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:12,380
there is another kiyum in Sefiras
HaOmer which is good bayom as well,

921
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:17,185
because it's the same kevius...

922
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:26,461
Is mimeilah, shochach velo manah balaylah
is moneh bayom belo bracha, there is no

923
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:32,801
bracha because the bracha is exclusively
connected with yachid, there is only

924
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,370
the kiyum from shiva 
shavuos tispor lach, ...

925
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:39,908
from kvius from shvuos, and kvius from shvuos is yom kasher.

926
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:43,211
But there is no bracha. 
Why is there no bracha?

927
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:48,016
Because now it is night, now it is night and the bracha is taluy in yachid.

928
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,019
Now it is day I mean.

929
01:19:51,019 --> 01:20:03,064
...the zeman mitzvah is balaylah, is
mimeilah he's moneh belo bracha because

930
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:07,636
there is no kiyum hayachid.The kiyum
hayachid is, is sefirah is balaila.

931
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:11,273
...kezayis matzah is balaylah,
the sefira is balaylah.

932
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:14,576
But however in kvius hatzibbur,
there is no zman laylah veyom.

933
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:22,617
The zman is, this depends whether
it is the same count or it's

934
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:25,854
a different count, and laylah
veyom don't differ in the count.

935
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:34,095
Mimeilah is laylah vayom don't differ
in the count, ... the chovas kevius

936
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:41,736
shvuos I fulfilled, what is missing is
... chelek hayachid ... there is no bracha.

937
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:42,938
Why no bracha?

938
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:54,416
Because now when I am counting bayom,
I don't yotzei the mitzvah from

939
01:20:54,416 --> 01:21:03,558
Sefiras HaOmer, totally, total Sefiras
HaOmer, is both kiyumim, that's why

940
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,826
there is no bracha.

941
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:09,331
But this is only to one day 
because now it is yom.

942
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:15,170
But the next, tomorrow, a bracha balaylah.

943
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:22,444
I did not lose it because yesterday's
sefirah was also a good sefirah,

944
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,779
with regard to kvius Chag HaShavuos.

945
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:30,151
And since yesterday's sefirah is a good
sefirah, ... Chag HaShavuos, is that

946
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,220
temimos is eliminated,

947
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:37,859
...temimos ... maintained, maintained.

948
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:50,472
mimeilah ...now I cannot say a bracha, 
because there's no mitzvas yachid.

949
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:51,706
Why is no mitzvas yachid?

950
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,441
Because it's daytime.

951
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:54,910
It's only balaylah.

952
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,879
But next night is a
mitzvas yachid as well.

953
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,781
Both kiyumim.

954
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:05,587
And the fact that I
counted at the daytime,

955
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:11,693
it means I saved the continuity,
continuous, ...mimeilah is a bracha.

956
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,529
What is here?

957
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:21,870
... veod nireh deafilu leman demachshir
ktziras homer bayom dieved modeh hu

958
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:28,643
legabei sefirah de'ein levarech bayom
mishum deshana alav hakasuv leakev,

959
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:36,451
dichsiv temimos, ve'i atah motzeh
temimos elah kesheatah moneh balaylah.

960
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:44,592
U'Behag kosav deheichah deinshi levarech
balaylah, yimneh lemachar bayom belo

961
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:50,832
bracha, vechein halacha, aval im shachach
laylah vayom lo yimneh od bivracha.

962
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:51,800
Why?

963
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,168
Debeinan temimos.

964
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:57,706
If shochach laylah vayom, there is
no temimos there is no continuity.

965
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,343
But if zachar bayom, there is continuity.

966
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,244
Why is there continuity?

967
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:06,448
Because there is another
kiyum which he maintained.

968
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:11,119
Namely, the kiyum from
kvius Chag HaShavuos.

969
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:14,456
Is mimeilah, why doesn't he
make a bracha on the daytime?

970
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:19,294
Because the yachid is, a sefirah
beyachid requires laylah,like a

971
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,896
kezayis matzah requires laylah.

972
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:25,767
But this is not a zman
from kvius beis din.

973
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:28,670
Kvius beis din balaylah
is a tartei desasrei.

974
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,674
Kvius beis din is not layom
valaylah, but what's kevius beis din?

975
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,878
Whether it is the same
minyan as laylah or not,

976
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:43,184
and since hayom holech achar halaylah,
is kevius beis din the same minyan, bayom

977
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:46,488
... kvius beis din ... the same minyan as if

978
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:51,860
I had counted last night.

979
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,030
Is mimeilah is no bracha.

980
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,566
But no bracha only on the day, I count,

981
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,635
I do count bayom.

982
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:07,809
But lemachar is ... a mayseh
sefirah balaylah, kemitzvasah.

983
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,812
When the continuity was saved by what?

984
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:16,017
By the sefirah from kvius Chag HaShavuos.

985
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:19,621
Is mimeilah he is mivarech

986
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,590
bebracha, that's how Tosfos...next night.

987
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,594
Now, now there is only one question.

988
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:30,865
I don't understand why the people,
why you didn't ask me... This question

989
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:38,540
is, if there is now one question which
is very important than anything else.

990
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:43,611
Is Chag HaShavuos, is it

991
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:49,217
actually, Chag HaShavuos
is nikba through sefirah?

992
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:58,726
The same manner as the yovel
is nikba through sefirah.

993
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:03,565
The Beis Din Hagadol used to count every
year, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, we don't

994
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:11,706
know exactly, count ... say, hashana hi
shnas hashviis lishmita rishonah l'yovel.

995
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:14,642
The Beis Din Hagadol used to do.

996
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:18,513
The Rayvad, the Rambam,
the Ramban, all have that.

997
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:22,750
[...Comment from audience.]

998
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,419
Correct, correct, correct.

999
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:33,094
Is mimeilah, if there is
no sefirah, is no Shavuos.

1000
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:44,572
Because Shavuos is not talui in
a date, it is a date, but the

1001
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:50,011
mikadesh, ... shvuos, is a maaseh sefirah.

1002
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:57,785
The gemara in Rosh Hashana says, amrah
Torah maneh shanim, vekadesh yovel.

1003
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:05,493
Amrah Torah maneh yomim vekadesh Atzeres.

1004
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,896
A gemara in Rosh Hashana.

1005
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:18,473
It is the same, the same kvius, which
yovel gets from the minyan hashemittos,

1006
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,842
so Shavuos gets from the minyan hayomim.

1007
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,010
The gemara.

1008
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,245
This is the gemara.

1009
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:34,122
So the question is, the question is, and
if there is no sefirah, no minyan for

1010
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:37,258
yemei hasefirah, 
you'd have no Shavuos.

1011
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,429
Is it possible to say?

1012
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:45,400
I would say the following, as far
as the Knesses Yisrael is concerned,

1013
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:50,772
they'll always, we believe that
Yisrael will always perform or

1014
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:53,975
fulfill the mitzvas sefirah.

1015
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:55,176
So there is no,

1016
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:59,881
no menace threatening, I
mean, the survival of Shavuos.

1017
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:07,455
But what do you do, most rishonim
are of the opinion, hasefirah

1018
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:08,923
bizman hazeh is derabbanan.

1019
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:12,093
Which means mideoraysa
there is no sefirah.

1020
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:13,895
How can there

1021
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:20,468
be a Chag HaShavuos mideoraysa,
and sefirah miderabbanan?

1022
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:25,873
If, of course, if we say that
the maaseh hasefirah, then I say

1023
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:31,579
hayom ... yom echad baomer, so I
say and Shavuos is 49 days off.

1024
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:38,386
When I say shnei yomim baomer,
implicitly there is a kevius

1025
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:42,490
for Shavuos ... sefirah, 
which is effective

1026
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:47,161
as far as Shavuos is
concerned... there's no sefirah.

1027
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,631
Ameimar manah yomei 
velo manah shvuei,

1028
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:57,672
amar zecher lemikdash.
It's actually when you

1029
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:04,512
take a look in the Medrash Shochar Tov
of Devarim, the Medrash Shochar Tov says

1030
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:11,819
Chag Shavuos ta'aseh lach, so the Medrash
Shochar Tov says afilu bizman hazeh.

1031
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,188
Afilu bizman hazeh.

1032
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:20,595
Why didn't the Medrash Shochar
Tov say that about Pesach

1033
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,530
and Sukkos, Rosh HaShannah?

1034
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:25,466
...Atzeres?

1035
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,469
Because there is no sefirah.

1036
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:36,044
I believe that there is 
something which

1037
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:41,683
we forgot to take into consideration.

1038
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:44,385
... in general kvius moadim.

1039
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:48,256
... in general kvius moadim bizman hazeh.

1040
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,826
How is it?

1041
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:57,765
... kvius moadim determined upon reiyah.

1042
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:02,637
Edus came and said ... Beis Din
is kovea the chodesh, and the

1043
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:07,508
chodesh is the reiyah is nikvah in
accordance with kevius beis din.

1044
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:14,182
But bizman hazeh there is no
reiyah, how is there kvius moadim?

1045
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,616
So the Rambam has

1046
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:19,253
this question, in perek hei
hilchos kiddush hachodesh, and

1047
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,456
he gives a very simple answer.

1048
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:25,026
There is a halacha leMoshe
miSinai ... moadim are

1049
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:29,230
nikbah through two methods.

1050
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,066
One method what?

1051
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:39,374
One method is reiyah, this is bizman
haMikdash, uvizman Beis Din Hagadol,

1052
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:43,978
be... halishkah lishkas hagazis.

1053
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:46,814
And another halacha leMoshe miSinai is

1054
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:53,688
that cheshbon, the moadim
are nikbah through chesbon.

1055
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,556
By whom are they nikbah?

1056
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:58,159
By the Klal Yisrael ...cheshbon?

1057
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,495
The chesbon ... the chesbon

1058
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:08,202
...You know be'emes we have the same
question we have vis-a-vis Shavuos,

1059
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:12,540
so the same question actually
applies to moadim in general.

1060
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:15,843
How are moadim bizman 
hazeh possible?

1061
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:20,415
Since eileh moadei Hashem
asher tikreu osum mikraei

1062
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:33,694
kodesh, I mean, does not apply to us,
because we require kvius beis din, and

1063
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,063
bizman hazeh we don't 
have kvius beis din.

1064
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:41,202
Nevermind Shavuos, now I'm asking
about ... Bizman Hazeh there is

1065
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,938
no kevius [inaudible].

1066
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:47,074
What is the answer according to the Rambam? What is the answer?

1067
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,443
Cheshbon.

1068
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:53,214
When there is no kvius beis
din, there is kviah by itself,

1069
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:56,651
kviah by itself, through what?

1070
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:57,785
Through cheshbon.

1071
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,188
This is Shavuos the same halacha.

1072
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:06,994
Be'emes is Shavuos requires kevius
not beis din, kevias kol yisrael.

1073
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,630
By what halacha?

1074
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:13,034
By the halachos of sefirah,
by the mitzvah of sefirah.

1075
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:21,809
The sha'ar moadim, bizman
habayis ... what is the kovea?

1076
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:23,277
Reiyah.

1077
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:26,814
Reiyah is sefirah, but different.

1078
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:37,191
... But there was a body, beis din as a
separate entity used to be kovea what?

1079
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:45,032
Use to be kovea all moadim on
the basis of reiyah, and kovea

1080
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:47,068
Shavuos on the basis of what?

1081
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:51,539
Of Sefiras HaOmer.

1082
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,808
Chorav Beis HaMikdash is batel sefirah.

1083
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,277
Chorav Beis HaMikdash is batel reiyah.

1084
01:31:56,277 --> 01:32:01,415
Is batel reiyah is batel, so there is no
Beis Din Hagadol there is no one to, on

1085
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:04,151
the Har HaBayis now of Beis Din HaGadol.

1086
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:10,558
So always we are not left without
moadim, but a mekadesh changes.

1087
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:14,195
Instead of reiyah, what is
a mekadesh bizman hazeh?

1088
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:17,265
Kevia al yedei cheshbon.

1089
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:23,638
Instead of sefirah,
there is another kovea.

1090
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:27,141
The kovea from Sefirah is
a kovea al yedei ma'aseh

1091
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:29,310
beis din, Klal Yisrael.

1092
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,946
There is another kovea,
what is the other kovea?

1093
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:38,486
In Chesbon, is sefirah, the maaseh
sefirah whether it's mideoraysa or

1094
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:40,755
miderabanan lo maaleh velo morid.

1095
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:46,861
The chesbon which is kovea Pesach ... by
the kevius of Pesach, because sefirah

1096
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:53,034
is dependent upon, the moed for Shavuos
... Shavuos doesn't have a separate zman.

1097
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:55,803
Shavuos does not have a separate zeman.

1098
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:59,640
It has a kevius from Pesach, what
is kovea pesach is kovea Shavuos.

1099
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:05,413
Is bazman hazeh, sefirah
mideoraysa is not sefirah the kovea

1100
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:09,216
but the Klal Yisrael through cheshbon.

1101
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:16,791
But bizman habayis, ... reiyah was
number one, but there is sefirah.

1102
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:23,731
The only question is, since bizman
hazeh there is no sefirah, sefirah not

1103
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:25,566
the kovea, what's the kovea?

1104
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,201
The cheshbon.

1105
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:34,475
So why should I be mekayem
a mitzvah if I should count

1106
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:39,614
sefirah, fulfill a double mitzvah.

1107
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:43,284
Bizman hazeh...what is kovea?

1108
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:44,819
The cheshbon.

1109
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:45,653
What is the cheshbon?

1110
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,521
From Pesach is kovea.

1111
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:48,756
Chamishim yom.

1112
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:56,597
What I'm interested is to say is that
there is a maaseh kevius on Shavuos.

1113
01:33:56,597 --> 01:33:59,500
Shavuos is not like Pesach,
Pesach has no maaseh kevius.

1114
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:06,007
Shavuos is, if you have to say,
...mimachoras hashabbat until Shavuos,

1115
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:11,045
hayom hayom hayom hayom, and this
maaseh kevius, which hundreds of Jews

1116
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:13,681
or thousands of Jews say is kovea.

1117
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,816
The question is, what is bizman hazeh?

1118
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:18,152
If sefirah is miderabanan?

1119
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:20,221
What did we answer?

1120
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:23,491
What did we answer?

1121
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:28,729
There is Shavuos ... chesbon from
Pesach, is sefirah is not a factor

1122
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:33,401
bizman hazeh, the factor bizman hazeh
is not sefirah, but what is the factor?

1123
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:38,939
[Inaudible] [Answer from audience.]
The chesbon ...the cheshbon of Pesach.

1124
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:49,717
Is mimeilah, the sefirah [inaudible]
is only one aspect, is not a mikadesh

1125
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:56,090
bizman hazeh ... one kiyum in sefirah,
namely the chovas hayachid and not

1126
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:57,692
a mitzvah from kevius beis din.

1127
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:05,433
This is the only difficulty I
encountered with [inaudible].

1128
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:09,036
[Question from audience]

1129
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:21,982
You may say that miderabanan
is sefirah also a kovea, but

1130
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:24,051
mideoraysa you don't need it.

1131
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:28,055
Mideoraysa you have the
kevius from chesbon.

1132
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:31,659
Umiderabanan...yeah

1133
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:47,374
Now that Sefirah is a kovea, that sefirah
is a kovea, bizman habayis definitely, but

1134
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:50,544
perhaps bizman hazeh too, 
is the chachmei

1135
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:52,413
hakabbalah accepted it.

1136
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:59,153
Because the chachmei hakabbalah
had a different interpretation

1137
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:06,427
of the minhag yisrael which
considered sefirah a zman aveilus.

1138
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:11,866
Of course, I mean, we take for granted
that sefirah is a zman aveilus,

1139
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:13,801
because of talmidei Rabbi Akiva.

1140
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:20,641
...Rabbi Akiva's talmidim died, so
many thousands of them died, ...Pesach

1141
01:36:20,641 --> 01:36:25,946
LeAtzeres ... batlah Torah miYisrael.

1142
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:36,423
This is our interpretation.

1143
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:41,796
And within, within the frame of
reference of this interpretation

1144
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,865
that the aveilus of yemei hasefirah

1145
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:51,438
is due to the incident,
the Talmidei Rabbi Akiva,

1146
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:54,675
in conjunction with

1147
01:36:54,675 --> 01:37:03,717
this interpretation, we consider the
aveilus from Sefirah as limited, it

1148
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:06,887
means before, lamed gimmel baomer.

1149
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:16,397
The balance between Lag BaOmer and
Shavuos, [inaudible] no aveilus.

1150
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:23,103
But the Gemara in Yevamos says, shekulam
meisu b'fros atzeres, which means 14 days

1151
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:26,473
before Atzeres, it's around Lag BaOmer.

1152
01:37:26,907 --> 01:37:34,281
The 14 days ...shekulam meisu, and that's
why the Mechaber says that lamed gimmel

1153
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:37,351
baomer is still included in aveilus.

1154
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:45,626
But Lamed Daled baboker, miktzas hayom kekulo, is the aveilus terminated.

1155
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:48,028
Terminated and forgotten.

1156
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,334
The Rama, the Rama says that
our minhag is not like this.

1157
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:56,770
Our minhag is that

1158
01:37:56,770 --> 01:38:02,343
Lag BaOmer itself, that after Lag
BaOmer, we still continue to

1159
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:04,845
observe yemei aveilus of sefirah.

1160
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:09,049
But Lag BaOmer itself for some
unknown reason, Lag BaOmer

1161
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:11,051
itself is a Yom Tov though.

1162
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:12,686
What is the Yom Tov for?

1163
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:16,957
But anyway, this is the shita of the Rama.

1164
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:22,263
This is shitas HaRama, and shittas

1165
01:38:22,263 --> 01:38:29,603
HaBeis Yosef is the source of aveilus
during days of Sefirah is some historical

1166
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:34,642
event which took place 1800, 1900 years ago.

1167
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:46,186
The aveilus was imposed
later bizman Rabbi Akiva.

1168
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:50,357
The Mekubalim have a different viewpoint.

1169
01:38:50,891 --> 01:38:56,430
They say that Sefirah itself
contains the experience of aveilus.

1170
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,899
Where there is vesafrah, sefirah,

1171
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:08,442
the act of of counting, of counting tumas
hameis, zav and zava, metzora, to count,

1172
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:09,843
we just read the parshiyos.

1173
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:15,916
...u'safrah lah shivas 
yomim letahorosah.

1174
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:24,391
V'safra lah, is during the shivas yomim, which there is nihug aveilus.

1175
01:39:24,391 --> 01:39:30,698
In metzora we find, in
Chumash,... a metzora is a naval.

1176
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:36,670
We have ibayos in the Gemara in Moed
Katan, which issurei aveilus are

1177
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:39,006
are applicable to kohein gadol or not.

1178
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:42,309
But it's a davar pashut that there 
is an element of aveilus 

1179
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:44,845
in metzora, mideoraysa aveilus.

1180
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:51,552
Al safam yaateh, many of the practices of aveilus which we Rachmana litzlan observe

1181
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:58,325
is due to the fact that we
consider the observance of tzora'as as

1182
01:39:58,325 --> 01:40:02,730
an aveilus, as an aveilus experience.

1183
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:10,804
Wherever there is vesafrah lah, vesafar lo, shivas yomim

1184
01:40:10,804 --> 01:40:15,275
tisper lo, is there is aveilus.

1185
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:29,523
Umimeilah, hence, the minhagim which
are asur, their issur is applicable

1186
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:33,394
to the pre-Lag BaOmer period and
to the post-Lag BaOmer period.

1187
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:37,364
It is the same Sefirah, you
cannot say that the Sefirah

1188
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:40,034
is terminated by Lag BaOmer.

1189
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,036
The Sefirah is during the

1190
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:47,474
entire period of Sefiras HaOmer.

1191
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:53,347
Vesofrah, vesofrah,
means when a man suffers.

1192
01:40:53,347 --> 01:40:57,084
[Comment from audience.] Just a moment.

1193
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:02,156
Just a moment.The Halacha from Sefirah.

1194
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:04,258
Why is it so?

1195
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:12,533
Why is Sefirah a symbol of ... and
the Sefirah, because each Sefirah,

1196
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:14,501
be'emes we have Sefirah only with regard

1197
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:15,669
to a naval,

1198
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:18,505
to I mean, with regard to tumah.

1199
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:20,741
Where do you have Sefirah in the Torah?

1200
01:41:21,775 --> 01:41:23,610
Tumah, in tumah.

1201
01:41:23,610 --> 01:41:30,451
Shivas yomim, zav v'zava, tumas
meis, tumas meis, what else?

1202
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:31,752
Niddah?

1203
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:32,953
Ah?

1204
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:33,587
[Anser from audience] What?

1205
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:50,204
Metzora...When one has to emerge
from the depths of tumah into a

1206
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:58,112
world of taharah, is this process of
emerging, this is a process of teshuva,

1207
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:01,148
basically it is the process of teshuva.

1208
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:08,188
This process of emerging from a
dark, contaminated, defiled world

1209
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:14,027
into a world, shekulo tov, this
process itself is one of suffering.

1210
01:42:15,395 --> 01:42:20,501
Baalei teshuva, I mean, enjoy still later.

1211
01:42:20,501 --> 01:42:25,672
But a baal teshuva I mean, when he
goes through the period of hakaras

1212
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:32,179
hachet and vidui, vidui devarim, and
when he has to surrender completely,

1213
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:42,089
surrender completely, and when he has
to accuse himself, to indict himself,

1214
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:45,826
I mean, of the aveiros he committed.

1215
01:42:46,293 --> 01:42:48,128
All this is suffering.

1216
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:54,568
And it is self... and the whole
hakaras hachet is self-torture.

1217
01:42:55,903 --> 01:43:01,108
Is mimeilah ... that if the Jews in
Mitzrayim were in the mem-tes shaarei

1218
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:08,248
tumah, and they had to emerge into a
world of Sinai, of Kabbalas HaTorah

1219
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:10,384
and gilui Shechinah, this emergence,

1220
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:12,152
because of the contrast,

1221
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:18,425
because the contrast is so, is so
amazingly different, frightening, just

1222
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:24,798
seven weeks before, they were at the
bottom of shaarei tumah, of complete

1223
01:43:25,632 --> 01:43:32,172
degradation and complete corruption,
and on Shavuos they already stood at the

1224
01:43:32,606 --> 01:43:39,646
foot ... of the mountain, and they shouted
naaseh v'nishma, they were at the apex.

1225
01:43:39,646 --> 01:43:45,052
But this slow, slow climbing,
climbing from the bottom of the

1226
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:50,924
mountain, the tachtis hahar, to the
top of the of the mountain, this

1227
01:43:50,924 --> 01:43:57,231
climbing is very difficult, replete

1228
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,699
with suffering.

1229
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:00,267
And this is Sefiras HaOmer.

1230
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:03,237
And that's why there is aveilus.

1231
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:07,207
Why there is aveilus.

1232
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:08,976
...this is according to Mekubalim.

1233
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:16,250
And the Mekubalim the minhag
by many many is not to observe

1234
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,286
aveilus ... on lamed gimmel baomer.

1235
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:24,191
Because according to that interpretation,
is lamed gimmel baomer not much

1236
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:32,399
different from the previous, from
the days, from pre-Lag BaOmer days.

1237
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:38,138
[Question from the
audience] What do you say?

1238
01:44:38,138 --> 01:44:46,913
[Question from the audience] [Inaudible]
and since I didn't answer him, I

1239
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:49,016
don't have to answer you either.

1240
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,150
It's a different kind of Sefirah.

1241
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:51,385
A different kind of Sefirah.

1242
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:54,755
[Comment from the audience]

1243
01:44:54,755 --> 01:44:58,058
I don't need a terutz, [inaudible].

1244
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:03,997
If you read the parsha,
please, if you read the parsha

1245
01:45:03,997 --> 01:45:05,799
from Sefiras HaOmer, please.

1246
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:15,342
If you read the parsha of Sefiras
HaOmer the way it appears in Emor,

1247
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:23,016
in the kriah of the Shabbos which
will come, we encounter difficulties

1248
01:45:23,016 --> 01:45:25,218
in understanding the parsha.

1249
01:45:26,253 --> 01:45:27,554
The parsha says as

1250
01:45:27,554 --> 01:45:29,289
follows, it's very strange:

1251
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:34,761
...Here it is.

1252
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:39,933
The Torah speaks about Pesach: chamishah

1253
01:45:39,933 --> 01:45:43,337
asar yom lachodesh hazeh chag
hamatzos lashem, shivas yomim matzos

1254
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:47,708
tocheilu, bayom harishon mikra
kodesh, vehikravtem isheh ladoshem

1255
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:52,412
shivas yomim, bayom harishon mikra
kodesh, kol meleches avodah lo sa'asu.

1256
01:45:52,746 --> 01:45:54,214
...Good, fine.

1257
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:57,417
Then suddenly, vayidaber
Adoshem el Moshe leimor.

1258
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:00,187
What does it mean?

1259
01:46:00,554 --> 01:46:05,625
Daber el Bnei Yisrael veamarta
aleihem ki savo'u el ha'aretz asher

1260
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:10,263
Ani nosein lachem, Whenever your
come, you'll cross into the land of

1261
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:13,600
Eretz Yisrael, uktzartem es ktzirah.

1262
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:17,571
You will harvest the land.

1263
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:22,609
Vahaveisem es omer reishis ktzirchem el hakohen.

1264
01:46:22,609 --> 01:46:27,881
Veheinif hakohein...yenifenu
Hakohein. Va'asisem beyom hanifchem

1265
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:33,620
es haomer, keves tomim...velechem
vekoli vecharmel...Usfartem

1266
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:37,524
lachem mimochoras haShabbos
miyom haviachem es omer hatnufah,

1267
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:39,426
sheva Shabbasos temimos tiheyena.

1268
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:45,732
Ad mimochoras haShabbos hashvi'is
tisperu chamishim yom vehikravtem mincha

1269
01:46:45,732 --> 01:46:48,368
chadasha laHashem and so on, and so on.

1270
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:53,440
Basically, is

1271
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:58,779
the Torah speaks before about Yom
Hashvi'i, bayom hashvi'i mikra

1272
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:01,081
kodesh kol meleches avodah lo sa'asu.

1273
01:47:01,882 --> 01:47:07,487
And then the Torah after Yom Hashvi'i
begins to speak immediately about what?

1274
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:09,156
About Sefiras HaOmer and

1275
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:15,695
Chodosh... It should
have been differently.

1276
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:20,233
Should have been, Eileh

1277
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:23,303
moadei Hashem mikraei kodesh asher
tikreu osam bemoadam, vehikravtem isheh

1278
01:47:23,303 --> 01:47:26,440
laHashem shivas yomim bayom hashvi'i
mikrah kodesh, kol meleches avodah lo

1279
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:34,181
sa'asu, before daber el Bnei Yisrael
v'amarta aleihem ki savo'u el ha'aretz

1280
01:47:34,181 --> 01:47:35,849
u'ketzartem es ktzirah, because this is on

1281
01:47:35,849 --> 01:47:38,852
the second day, and
this is the seventh day.

1282
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:45,592
In general is, why is it necessary to say
... chi savo'u el ha'aretz asher Ani nosein

1283
01:47:45,592 --> 01:47:49,162
lachem u'ktzartem es ktzirah v'haveisem
es omer reishis ketzirchem el hakohen.

1284
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:50,363
Why is it all that

1285
01:47:50,363 --> 01:47:51,665
necessary to say?

1286
01:47:51,665 --> 01:47:55,168
The Torah should have said, I mean,
...chodosh and vekoli vecharmel

1287
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:56,837
lo sochlu ad etzem hayom hazeh.

1288
01:47:56,837 --> 01:47:59,506
The impression when

1289
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:05,479
we study the parsha, what we get as
if the Torah is deviating from the

1290
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:10,083
theme and picks up a different theme

1291
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:12,385
which is important.

1292
01:48:15,188 --> 01:48:18,725
Basically, the

1293
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:21,094
Sefiras HaOmer, if you
remember, [inaudible].

1294
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:29,336
Sefiras HaOmer represents something
which was frightening to the people,

1295
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:34,174
to the Jews who came out of Mitzrayim,
who were in Mitzrayim, something which

1296
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:39,746
apparently they couldn't understand
well what it is, and they were afraid.

1297
01:48:40,614 --> 01:48:42,682
What was the problem?

1298
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:44,818
The problem was a simple one.

1299
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:52,459
We have in the safrus hadrush, drush
and machshava, we have it in Mekubalim,

1300
01:48:53,126 --> 01:49:00,534
in the ... HaMekubalim, Kabbalah, that
with Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, a certain

1301
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:12,412
definitive rift took place, Yetzi'as
Mitzrayim, Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, excuse me.

1302
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:15,782
The Jews expected,

1303
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:26,626
excuse me...As long as the people
were in Mitzrayim, they were under

1304
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:31,164
hashgacha, hashgacha al-tivis,

1305
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:34,267
a supranatural dimension.

1306
01:49:34,267 --> 01:49:39,639
The event, the event which happened
in Mitzrayim, when I say events

1307
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:41,441
happened in Mitzrayim, I mean both,

1308
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:50,050
before Moshe arrived with the message
of geulah, and after it arrived,

1309
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:55,755
the message of geulah, ushered in
an era, an era in Jewish history.

1310
01:49:55,755 --> 01:50:00,727
This era, I mean, if you'll just
count Moshe's arrival, about 40 years.

1311
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:09,970
If this era started already, began,
it was ushered in prior to Moshe,

1312
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:14,674
so it was a hundred years old.

1313
01:50:15,575 --> 01:50:23,917
Namely that the Jews were placed
under the perspective and under

1314
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:27,587
hashgacha pratis, al-nissis

1315
01:50:27,587 --> 01:50:31,491
I mean, supernatural hashgacha.

1316
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:33,193
Because if

1317
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:38,965
HaKadosh Baruch Hu had not employed
this method, so one of the methods

1318
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:43,837
of hashgacha which HaKadosh Baruch
Hu employs from time to time, the

1319
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:45,939
method of hashgacha, al-nissis.

1320
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:52,278
Ayin Lamed Nun Samech Yud
Suf, means, supernatural.

1321
01:50:53,847 --> 01:50:57,384
The categories which are reflected

1322
01:50:57,384 --> 01:51:07,961
by such a hashgacha are not the categories
of causality, of natural causality which

1323
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:16,002
prevail in the physical as well as
in the historical world.

1324
01:51:16,536 --> 01:51:19,139
It's categories we don't understand.

1325
01:51:19,139 --> 01:51:26,946
Which simply defy causality, naturalness,
and unity of the cosmic process.

1326
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:33,153
Those hashgacha, this hashgacha pratis,
this hashgacha not pratis, lemaalah

1327
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:37,624
min hateva, al-tiv'is, this hashgacha

1328
01:51:37,624 --> 01:51:44,064
pratis was launched, I
mean, sponsored by

1329
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:50,036
HaKadosh Baruch Hu with his
appointment appointing Moshe,

1330
01:51:50,036 --> 01:51:52,772
when he spoke to him, 
es ha'osos vehamofsim.

1331
01:51:54,007 --> 01:52:04,384
Moshe's task was ... he should
be the representative and the

1332
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:10,523
leader of a community or of a
society which will be guided from

1333
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:17,163
the first day Moshe came to
Mitzrayim until, until what time?

1334
01:52:17,163 --> 01:52:18,998
Until what time?

1335
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:27,574
Until the entry into Eretz Yisrael,
will be placed completely in the

1336
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:33,780
dimensions of hashgacha tiv'is,
of hashgacha, nissis, al-tiv'is,

1337
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,116
hashgacha lemaalah min hateva.

1338
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:38,218
Different I mean.

1339
01:52:38,218 --> 01:52:45,158
...the question..., which for 40
years people were nourished, I mean,

1340
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:49,229
in a manner which we cannot imagine,
cannot understand now how it was.

1341
01:52:49,229 --> 01:52:55,568
...question of Krias Yam Suf, zeh
Keili veanveihu, as Chazal say

1342
01:52:55,568 --> 01:53:01,274
that each infant or each child, I mean,
pointed out with his little finger,

1343
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:04,511
there is God... kind of gilui Shechinah.

1344
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:07,514
But not every dor, not
every dor, no dor has

1345
01:53:07,514 --> 01:53:12,919
achieved such distinction.

1346
01:53:12,919 --> 01:53:21,728
And no dor, and no dor, no generation,
no generation was placed completely,

1347
01:53:21,728 --> 01:53:27,934
completely under the cloth of al-nissi.

1348
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:32,005
Supernatural.

1349
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:36,342
The cosmic order did not function
as far as the Jews in Mitzrayim

1350
01:53:36,342 --> 01:53:38,711
and the midbar are concerned.

1351
01:53:39,879 --> 01:53:49,155
Basically is, we hope that this order will
be renewed and will be reestablished at

1352
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:52,192
the time of the final geulah, 
redemption.

1353
01:53:52,192 --> 01:53:56,062
Kimei tzeischa me'eretz mitzrayim arenu niflaos.

1354
01:53:56,062 --> 01:54:01,434
But Mitzrayim, Yetzi'as Mitzrayim
represents what kind of hashgacha?

1355
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:05,905
Osos umofsim. Lemaalah min hateva.

1356
01:54:06,706 --> 01:54:08,241
An hashgacha

1357
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:12,912
that you can put over to this
table and scratch it and it should

1358
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:17,283
be, and there should be, the
table should start hemorrhaging.

1359
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:22,088
Lechem min hashamayim.

1360
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:26,159
The Torah min hashamayim.

1361
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:32,165
The onesh, onshin, the
penalties are swift in coming.

1362
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:35,268
Are swift, are swift in coming.

1363
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:44,711
As a matter of fact, people ask, why is
it, why when the Bnei Aharon, the kashya

1364
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,813
is be'emes Chazal raised the kashya.

1365
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:49,115
The Bnei Aharon, what did they do?

1366
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:52,585
Not a vulgar aveirah.

1367
01:54:52,585 --> 01:54:55,922
Moshe Rabbeinu said about 
Bnei Aharon that.

1368
01:54:58,992 --> 01:55:01,194
Bekrovai ekodesh.

1369
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:04,530
And I thought that bekrovai
ekodesh refers to us.

1370
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:10,270
But now I find out, I found out that
the Bnei Aharon were superior to us.

1371
01:55:11,371 --> 01:55:12,805
Why is it

1372
01:55:12,805 --> 01:55:15,942
so that the punishment
was so swift in coming?

1373
01:55:15,942 --> 01:55:18,244
Quickly, swift in coming.

1374
01:55:18,244 --> 01:55:20,380
And we ask,

1375
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:29,622
in history, even if HaKadosh
Baruch Hu punishes somebody

1376
01:55:29,622 --> 01:55:32,458
for chet, he's not so swift.

1377
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:36,362
Notzer chesed la'alafim,
rav chesed veemes.

1378
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:39,198
Ve'ad yom moso techakeh lo.

1379
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:48,274
The attribute of HaKadosh
Baruch Hu is rav chesed ve'emes.

1380
01:55:48,274 --> 01:56:02,288
The Chazal say, ... vayimaher
Moshe vayikod artzcha vayishtachu.

1381
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:04,390
... Chazal vayishtachu.

1382
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:09,429
What did he hear when 
he prostrated himself?

1383
01:56:09,429 --> 01:56:11,264
So one says emes.

1384
01:56:11,664 --> 01:56:15,134
And we say, ...one man deamar 
says chessed.

1385
01:56:15,134 --> 01:56:19,105
Because the whole emes, the
methods of teshuva would have been

1386
01:56:19,105 --> 01:56:23,609
completely irrelevant if HaKadosh
Baruch Hu had exercised middas

1387
01:56:23,609 --> 01:56:26,713
haemes and not middas hachesed.

1388
01:56:26,713 --> 01:56:31,417
HaKadosh Baruch Hu's patience
and perseverance and his

1389
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:34,754
graciousness as a baal

1390
01:56:34,754 --> 01:56:39,459
hachesed makes teshuva workable,
makes teshuva possible.

1391
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:45,765
If Hakadosh Baruch Hu had dealt with
chotim in the same manner as he dealt with

1392
01:56:45,765 --> 01:56:53,206
Nadav veAvihu, so the whole promise of
teshuva would have been completely wasted,

1393
01:56:54,273 --> 01:56:57,176
would have been completely wasted.

1394
01:56:57,176 --> 01:56:59,779
What's the use of HaKadosh
Baruch Hu as a mikabel biteshuva?

1395
01:56:59,779 --> 01:57:02,181
It takes the sinner,

1396
01:57:02,181 --> 01:57:06,686
it takes the sinner a couple
of years before he gets

1397
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:08,721
used to the idea of teshuva.

1398
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:12,992
But the trouble is if the same method
which HaKadosh Baruch Hu applied to

1399
01:57:12,992 --> 01:57:17,830
Nadav veAvihu would be applied to
any choteh, so then the whole

1400
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:20,700
Yom Kippur has absolutely 
no significance.

1401
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:25,071
And that's what Chazal say,
vayimaher Moshe vayishtachu.

1402
01:57:25,071 --> 01:57:26,105
Ma ra'ah?

1403
01:57:26,105 --> 01:57:27,373
What did he hear?

1404
01:57:27,373 --> 01:57:31,944
He heard something
which quieted his heart.

1405
01:57:31,944 --> 01:57:39,519
And he was not, which actually gave
him a, making him understand that

1406
01:57:39,519 --> 01:57:44,791
the message of
teshuva is valid and will be carried

1407
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:48,961
out, implemented, because HaKadosh
Baruch Hu will not push the choteh.

1408
01:57:48,961 --> 01:57:52,298
He will stand only at the door and
will wait for the choteh to come.

1409
01:57:53,232 --> 01:58:00,540
If this is the case, and now in rav
chesed v'emes, one of the 13 attributes,

1410
01:58:01,507 --> 01:58:09,015
when you...ochez biyad midas mishpat, we
announce quite solemnly ve'ad yom moso

1411
01:58:09,015 --> 01:58:12,051
techakeh lo, im yashuv miyad tekablo.

1412
01:58:12,051 --> 01:58:14,320
HaKadosh Baruch Hu has patience kaveyachol

1413
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:17,056
to wait for a choteh 
to do teshuva,

1414
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:22,095
the whole lifespan of 70 or 80 years.

1415
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:26,833
So why wasn't this chesed
bestowed upon Nadav vaAvihu?

1416
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:30,103
And in general, I think in
Tanach, not only Nadav vaAvihu.

1417
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:32,772
For instance ... we read it in Shemini.

1418
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:35,441
Dovid, Dovid made a mistake.

1419
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:42,381
The aron habris was not carried
on the shoulders of the 

1420
01:58:42,381 --> 01:58:48,020
kohanim and halvi'im, but ba'agalah,
in a wagon, in a carriage.

1421
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:54,293
...avodas hakodesh aleihem bakosef yisau.

1422
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:59,432
Is right away, ...they still
were marching to the place of

1423
01:58:59,432 --> 01:59:04,637
the aron, where the aron had

1424
01:59:04,637 --> 01:59:06,038
to be enshrined.

1425
01:59:06,038 --> 01:59:11,043
Then suddenly vayach Adoshem makah
aza, and Uza, the whole manager of

1426
01:59:11,043 --> 01:59:18,618
this affair, Uza, whom Dovid entrusted,
whom Dovid entrusted with actually

1427
01:59:18,618 --> 01:59:23,823
executing the transfer of the aron
into Nov VeGivon, into the Beis

1428
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:27,827
Hamikdash, this Uza died immediately.

1429
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:29,996
After all, it's not an issur
kares, ki avodas hakodesh

1430
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,898
aleihem bakosef yisau, 

1431
01:59:31,898 --> 01:59:33,166
Why so suddenly?

1432
01:59:33,499 --> 01:59:42,542
Why did his death actually, I mean,
take place on the same day, and

1433
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:50,249
and the whole simcha was completely eliminated and so forth?

1434
01:59:50,249 --> 01:59:51,717
What is the answer?

1435
01:59:51,717 --> 02:00:00,193
The answer is, those people lived not under hashgacha tivis

1436
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:04,130
but under hashgacha al-tivis, 
lema'ala min hateva.

1437
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:06,599
And if the adono shel olam

1438
02:00:06,999 --> 02:00:13,706
is good enough to change cosmic
order in order to save or to

1439
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:15,875
protect a certain community or a

1440
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:22,848
yachid, this particular community
or this particular yachid

1441
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:24,750
must not make any mistake.

1442
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:30,656
If Hakadosh Baruch Hu breaks the
cosmic order in order to facilitate

1443
02:00:30,656 --> 02:00:34,894
and to make it simpler for the yachid

1444
02:00:35,494 --> 02:00:40,800
to achieve what he wants, the way
Hakadosh Baruch Hu broke all the

1445
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,168
precedents with regard to Dovid.

1446
02:00:42,168 --> 02:00:43,369
Who was Dovid?

1447
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:46,639
Dovid was a shepherd boy.

1448
02:00:47,006 --> 02:00:50,443
And apparently, according to
Chazal, whether shepherd boy we

1449
02:00:50,443 --> 02:00:53,079
say it in yiddish [yiddish phrase].

1450
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:59,318
The family didn't think
much of Dovid as a leader.

1451
02:00:59,952 --> 02:01:07,293
You see even Shmuel, could not
believe that this is the leader of

1452
02:01:07,293 --> 02:01:14,100
a Melech Yisrael, who will be the
ancestor of the Melech Hamoshiach.

1453
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:18,704
[Inaudible] When Avishai opens his
mouth ... Dovid, You see that

1454
02:01:18,704 --> 02:01:19,839
he had more

1455
02:01:19,839 --> 02:01:21,374
regard for them.

1456
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:26,646
And the Medrash tells us Baruch haba

1457
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:27,480
beshem Adoshem,

1458
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:32,585
keil hashem vayoer lanu isru chag
ba'avosim ad karnos hamizbeach.

1459
02:01:32,585 --> 02:01:33,686
Who said it?

1460
02:01:33,686 --> 02:01:34,720
Avishai said it.

1461
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:39,458
Because Avishai considered
Dovid as a retarded [inaudible].

1462
02:01:40,726 --> 02:01:45,531
And suddenly the navi came
and anoints Dovid with

1463
02:01:45,531 --> 02:01:48,401
the shemen hamishcha and

1464
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:50,303
said that he's the Melech Yisrael.

1465
02:01:50,636 --> 02:01:52,071
Keil Adoshem vayor lanu.

1466
02:01:52,071 --> 02:02:00,012
Suddenly, suddenly Dovid, and the
hashgacha, the hashgacha nisis was spread

1467
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:06,452
like a cloth which is spread to protect
somebody from moisture and ... cold.

1468
02:02:06,452 --> 02:02:09,655
It was spread over
Dovid's head all his life.

1469
02:02:09,655 --> 02:02:17,697
And that's why ...Dovid should
have been doubly sure about the

1470
02:02:17,697 --> 02:02:26,339
legitimate, about the halacha with
regard to the transfer of an aron.

1471
02:02:26,339 --> 02:02:30,609
And even if the mistake is a
small one, a very mild mistake,

1472
02:02:30,609 --> 02:02:32,912
he shouldn't have made a mistake.

1473
02:02:34,547 --> 02:02:40,319
When a Jew bizman hazeh makes a
mistake, is the Jew bizman hazeh

1474
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:49,762
is not tachas hashgacha nisis,
he is tachas hashgachas hateva.

1475
02:02:50,162 --> 02:02:56,836
The natural, under the
natural cosmic order.

1476
02:02:56,836 --> 02:03:00,039
Nothing in the cosmos changes for us.

1477
02:03:00,906 --> 02:03:04,610
No nissim geluim ...what
we call no nissim geluim.

1478
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:09,482
Then is the cosmic order according
to Chazal came to an end with

1479
02:03:09,482 --> 02:03:10,983
Esther Hamalka.

1480
02:03:10,983 --> 02:03:15,988
Already Esther Hamalka worked not with
miracles, she worked a lot with wisdom

1481
02:03:15,988 --> 02:03:18,724
and seichel and tact and understanding.

1482
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:22,128
She [inaudible].

1483
02:03:22,928 --> 02:03:26,899
And this is why, why it was
[inaudible] very simple.

1484
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:29,468
Achashverosh signed the order.

1485
02:03:29,468 --> 02:03:40,346
His hand suddenly was paralyzed,
or Achashverosh, he could have

1486
02:03:40,346 --> 02:03:42,615
died the same night he signed the order.

1487
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:52,324
Because the nes Purim is a nes lemata
min hanes, lemata bederech hateva.

1488
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:54,226
It was bederech hateva.

1489
02:03:54,226 --> 02:03:57,630
It was a different, a
different order given.

1490
02:03:57,630 --> 02:04:06,939
The cosmic orderliness
and the causal nexus which

1491
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:14,079
causality is responsible for, was
not noticeable, I say noticeable in

1492
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:18,117
the incident with Esther and Achashverosh.

1493
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:24,356
And Hakadosh Baruch Hu let Esther
do, use her own wisdom, her own

1494
02:04:24,356 --> 02:04:31,530
intelligence and planning, But he
did not place Esther and the Knesses

1495
02:04:31,530 --> 02:04:38,003
Yisrael at that time under hashgacha
al-tivis, or lema'ala min hateva.

1496
02:04:39,839 --> 02:04:48,113
Esther was the last book of the kisvei
hakodesh, in all other books of kisvei

1497
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:53,452
hakodesh, is the events described, events
from Dovid and Shlomo Rechavam, the events

1498
02:04:53,452 --> 02:04:55,921
described is lema'ala miderech hateva.

1499
02:04:56,589 --> 02:05:01,494
If it's lema'ala miderech
hateva, the reward comes swiftly,

1500
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:03,529
but the punishment comes as

1501
02:05:03,529 --> 02:05:05,531
quickly as the reward.

1502
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:10,970
And that's why when we read
the Chumash about makas

1503
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:15,508
bechoros, we don't understand
what it's all about.

1504
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:19,278
Hakadosh Baruch Hu said that we
should bring a Paschal lamb, and

1505
02:05:19,278 --> 02:05:22,515
offer the Paschal lamb as a what?

1506
02:05:23,148 --> 02:05:28,954
As a protection against the malach
hamashchis who is supposed to

1507
02:05:28,954 --> 02:05:39,465
touch not only the Mitzrim but to
punish the, not only to punish the

1508
02:05:39,465 --> 02:05:43,369
Mitzrim ... but to protect the Yisrael?

1509
02:05:43,369 --> 02:05:44,637
No.

1510
02:05:44,637 --> 02:05:52,278
The malach apparently could have punished
the Yisrael and the Mitzrim as well.

1511
02:05:52,778 --> 02:05:57,583
And apparently there was not much,
there wasn't much reason to

1512
02:05:57,583 --> 02:06:00,419
simply, I mean, to defend Yisrael

1513
02:06:01,287 --> 02:06:07,192
because if later in Krias Yam Suf,
this was Uza's taynah.

1514
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:11,730
halalu halalu halalu
halalu halalu [inaudible].

1515
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,903
So the reason that the Yisrael
won the trial, 

1516
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:19,572
according to Chazal.

1517
02:06:19,572 --> 02:06:21,407
Yisrael and Mitzrayim.

1518
02:06:21,674 --> 02:06:23,676
Both were not good.

1519
02:06:24,109 --> 02:06:30,482
But apparently the reason
for the Bnei Yisrael,

1520
02:06:30,916 --> 02:06:43,762
the reason for the fact that the Bnei
Yisrael have won the trial, and the

1521
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:50,936
Mitzrim have lost the trial, is not to be
searched for in the dimension of hashgacha

1522
02:06:50,936 --> 02:06:53,606
tivis, but of hashgacha al tivis.

1523
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:56,609
This itself is the greatest of all nissim.

1524
02:06:56,609 --> 02:06:57,910
And in order that the

1525
02:06:57,910 --> 02:07:06,151
Yisrael should deserve to be saved and

1526
02:07:06,151 --> 02:07:11,857
survive this
catastrophe from Krias

1527
02:07:11,857 --> 02:07:14,693
Yam Suf, they needed a special korban.

1528
02:07:15,928 --> 02:07:17,663
And this is the korban from Pesach.

1529
02:07:18,263 --> 02:07:22,735
Al shem shepasach Hakadosh Baruch
Hu al batei avoseinu beMitzrayim.

1530
02:07:23,636 --> 02:07:26,672
...benagpo es mitzrayim
ve'es bateinu hitzil.

1531
02:07:26,672 --> 02:07:28,173
...What's all bateinu, what is bateinu?

1532
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:30,542
We are the slaves, we ...suffer.

1533
02:07:31,844 --> 02:07:33,412
So of course we should

1534
02:07:33,412 --> 02:07:34,813
have been saved.

1535
02:07:35,414 --> 02:07:37,082
Not the Mitzrim.

1536
02:07:37,082 --> 02:07:41,086
The answer is that apparently we
were guilty as well as the Mitzrim.

1537
02:07:41,286 --> 02:07:44,823
But at least it was quite close
to the guilt of the Mitzrim.

1538
02:07:44,823 --> 02:07:47,993
There was guilt on the part of
Yisrael and guilt on the Mitzrim.

1539
02:07:48,527 --> 02:07:51,196
There is a ish Mitzri makeh 
ish Ivri and so forth.

1540
02:07:51,196 --> 02:07:55,901
ish Mitzri makeh ish Ivri, shnei ivrim
nitzim and so forth, there are many many.

1541
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:57,369
The , [inaudible] meraglim.

1542
02:07:57,369 --> 02:08:04,543
Apparently there was no reason rationally,
rationally, the ratio, which is

1543
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:07,613
the representative of the
reason, the representative of the

1544
02:08:07,613 --> 02:08:14,720
hashgacha tivis, logically the
Bnei Yisrael should have lost.

1545
02:08:16,955 --> 02:08:21,660
For a simple reason, because the
Mitzrim had nobody to teach them.

1546
02:08:21,994 --> 02:08:25,297
The Bnei Yisrael who were Bnei
Avraham Yitzchak veYaakov.

1547
02:08:25,964 --> 02:08:29,068
So their responsibility
was by far above that,

1548
02:08:29,535 --> 02:08:31,637
a different one.

1549
02:08:31,637 --> 02:08:36,275
And this itself, that they haven't
inherited anything from Avraham,

1550
02:08:36,275 --> 02:08:38,477
Yitzchak veYaakov, this itself

1551
02:08:39,144 --> 02:08:44,750
was responsible for the possibility,
it's a strange possibility, that the

1552
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:49,588
Bnei Yisrael will be found guilty,
Rachmana litzlan, and the Mitzrim,

1553
02:08:49,588 --> 02:08:51,123
the Mitzrim will be set free.

1554
02:08:51,457 --> 02:08:57,162
That's why you needed a special
korban, this is the korban haPesach.

1555
02:08:57,796 --> 02:08:59,965
To protect the Bnei Yisrael from what?

1556
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:07,740
From the Hamalach Hamashchis because
there was a confrontation,

1557
02:09:08,006 --> 02:09:13,912
as Chazal tell us, between Malach
Michael and Uzza, who is guilty

1558
02:09:13,912 --> 02:09:15,948
and who is, who should be set free.

1559
02:09:16,381 --> 02:09:19,084
Only the korban made it possible.

1560
02:09:19,084 --> 02:09:28,160
For the hashgacha, for the hashgacha
al tivis, for the hashgacha

1561
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:30,262
lema'ala min hateva, that those

1562
02:09:30,262 --> 02:09:32,197
nissim were carried out if

1563
02:09:32,197 --> 02:09:33,966
we have not deserved this.

1564
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:45,911
[Inaudible] Because if it is
lema'ala min hateva, so the one who

1565
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:49,815
is protected by hashgacha lema'ala
min hateva should be perfect.

1566
02:09:50,382 --> 02:09:52,451
Should be clean and perfect.

1567
02:09:53,352 --> 02:10:00,159
A little stain can change the
whole historical, the course of

1568
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:04,997
historical events... The ... korban

1569
02:10:04,997 --> 02:10:10,068
pesach [inaudible] this
is the korban which saves.

1570
02:10:10,068 --> 02:10:14,039
This is the Rabban Gamliel said
shlosha dvarim ...bapesach. We

1571
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:15,107
don't know what is Pesach.

1572
02:10:15,107 --> 02:10:16,175
Matzah we understand.

1573
02:10:16,475 --> 02:10:19,178
It's geulah, sudden
geulah, but what is Pesach?

1574
02:10:19,178 --> 02:10:26,652
Pesach is because there was logically,
reasonably, the Jews could have

1575
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:31,156
lost the trial, and the Mitzrim
could have won the trial.

1576
02:10:31,156 --> 02:10:33,158
And this is what korban
Pesach is [inaudible].

1577
02:10:33,725 --> 02:10:42,534
This exactly Yetzias Mitzrayim.

1578
02:10:43,268 --> 02:10:50,075
But such a situation cannot continue
forever, such a situation, that a people

1579
02:10:50,075 --> 02:10:57,249
should exist only by being protected by

1580
02:10:57,249 --> 02:11:03,889
Hakadosh Baruch Hu under his private care,

1581
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:11,630
under his care and love to
such an extent that the laws of

1582
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:16,401
nature, the laws of history should

1583
02:11:16,401 --> 02:11:23,642
be considered completely completely
invalid and completely superfluous.

1584
02:11:24,343 --> 02:11:25,544
This cannot be forever.

1585
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:27,312
It can last for a hundred years.

1586
02:11:27,312 --> 02:11:31,850
It can last for ten years, for
a year during Moshe's reign.

1587
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:34,353
So it lasted for how long?

1588
02:11:35,053 --> 02:11:39,625
For a year in Mitzrayim, when Moshe
came about and forty years in midbar.

1589
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:40,492
...the midbar,

1590
02:11:40,492 --> 02:11:47,699
the whole existence, the whole existence
in the midbar is lema'ala min hateva.

1591
02:11:48,367 --> 02:11:53,071
But the very moment they crossed
the Jordan river, and there was no

1592
02:11:53,071 --> 02:11:59,378
amud haanan anymore, and no be'erah
shel Miriam, no amud haanan, and

1593
02:11:59,378 --> 02:12:07,719
no man from heaven, is the ... is
to exist like any other nation, but differently.

1594
02:12:08,387 --> 02:12:12,524
To exist tachas derech hateva.

1595
02:12:14,459 --> 02:12:28,073
So these people are accustomed to live
in an order which actually ignores the

1596
02:12:30,042 --> 02:12:36,682
cosmic categories in history, the
cosmic laws in history, it's a very

1597
02:12:36,682 --> 02:12:43,522
difficult, difficult suggestion.

1598
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:45,857
The Bnei Yisrael

1599
02:12:45,857 --> 02:12:53,298
who left Mitzrayim and went into the
midbar, they did not think that at

1600
02:12:53,298 --> 02:12:58,704
any time in history the hashgacha
pratis will be removed from them.

1601
02:12:59,471 --> 02:13:05,711
And they'll always be under the
hashgacha, under the order of lema'ala

1602
02:13:05,711 --> 02:13:08,113
min hateva, of a transcendental order.

1603
02:13:08,113 --> 02:13:09,514
They didn't believe.

1604
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:12,517
Since in Mitzrayim, the Jews were
under transcendental order, all

1605
02:13:12,517 --> 02:13:17,756
Yetzias Mitzrayim, this will continue
ad bias hamashiach, ad bias hagoel.

1606
02:13:18,557 --> 02:13:20,492
Vayedaber Adoshem el Moshe leimor.

1607
02:13:20,492 --> 02:13:22,561
Before he told them about Pesach.

1608
02:13:22,561 --> 02:13:25,664
Pesach is the chag lema'ala min hateva.

1609
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:28,567
We celebrate events lema'ala min hateva.

1610
02:13:28,567 --> 02:13:33,405
Namely, namely what is
lema'ala min hateva?

1611
02:13:33,405 --> 02:13:37,843
...everything in the midbar and everything
about Yetziat Mitzrayim nissim veniflaos!

1612
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:41,847
[Comment from audience] ... everything
I mean, a matter of fact the Chachmei

1613
02:13:41,847 --> 02:13:44,483
Yisrael say that the greatest nes

1614
02:13:47,953 --> 02:13:49,755
the greatest nes is the man

1615
02:13:49,755 --> 02:13:51,556
because it's forty years in succession.

1616
02:13:51,556 --> 02:13:52,791
Anyway, but it

1617
02:13:52,791 --> 02:13:54,593
cannot go on like that.

1618
02:13:55,961 --> 02:13:57,829
Ein somchim al hanes I mean.

1619
02:14:00,766 --> 02:14:06,471
Vayedaber Adoshem el Moshe leimor,
daber el Bnei Yisrael ve'amarta

1620
02:14:06,471 --> 02:14:13,678
aleihem ki savo'u el ha'aretz asher
ani nosein lachem...That's all.

1621
02:14:14,513 --> 02:14:16,281
Uktzartem es ketzirah.

1622
02:14:16,281 --> 02:14:17,416
They'll be no man.

1623
02:14:17,416 --> 02:14:18,483
No man.

1624
02:14:18,483 --> 02:14:22,220
Don't expect that you'll
find man in Eretz Yisrael.

1625
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:23,889
You'll have to plant.

1626
02:14:24,222 --> 02:14:27,726
You'll have to to attend to the harvest.

1627
02:14:28,193 --> 02:14:30,562
You'll have to reap, I mean the fruit.

1628
02:14:31,096 --> 02:14:32,664
Uktzartem es ktzirah.

1629
02:14:34,032 --> 02:14:38,503
But ...the order will be
an order, a natural order,

1630
02:14:38,503 --> 02:14:39,905
cosmic order.

1631
02:14:39,905 --> 02:14:44,342
Adam zoreah bishas zeriah,
veadam kotzer bishaas ktzirah.

1632
02:14:44,342 --> 02:14:51,183
There won't be any,
no miracles with man

1633
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:55,520
and no water coming out of 
the rock will happen to you.

1634
02:14:56,621 --> 02:15:02,160
But now I have to teach you how to live a
natural life in accordance with the Torah.

1635
02:15:04,329 --> 02:15:08,433
Before that you are taught how to eat
the Pesach -- mosneichem chagurim,

1636
02:15:08,433 --> 02:15:11,036
makelchem beyedchem -- this is

1637
02:15:11,036 --> 02:15:12,037
the mitzvos

1638
02:15:12,037 --> 02:15:19,077
which were necessary in order to
protect the Jews and to keep him 

1639
02:15:20,245 --> 02:15:23,882
in a dimension of lema'ala min hateva.

1640
02:15:24,249 --> 02:15:25,584
But with the bias

1641
02:15:25,584 --> 02:15:35,360
ha'aretz, interesting is, the pasuk in
... says achlu es haman ad boam el ktzei eretz

1642
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:43,168
noshaves and...vayochlu meavur haaretz.

1643
02:15:43,401 --> 02:15:45,737
Suddenly the man came to an end.

1644
02:15:45,737 --> 02:15:50,408
And with the man coming to an
end, not only the man and other

1645
02:15:50,408 --> 02:15:55,380
niflaos came to an end, but the
whole constellation of hashgacha

1646
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:56,648
came to an end.

1647
02:15:56,648 --> 02:16:01,286
This is changed from
hashgachas, from hashgacha

1648
02:16:01,286 --> 02:16:06,258
lema'ala min hateva into
hashgacha betoch hateva.

1649
02:16:06,258 --> 02:16:12,931
And this is uktzartem es ktzirah,
vahaveisem es omer reishis ktzirchem el

1650
02:16:12,931 --> 02:16:14,065
hakohein.

1651
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:17,536
But this should not degrade
you this change, this change

1652
02:16:17,536 --> 02:16:18,637
should not mislead you.

1653
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:22,174
I'll be with you, with you
and all the promises will be

1654
02:16:22,174 --> 02:16:24,943
fulfilled, but in a different way.

1655
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:31,416
Veheinif es haomer lifnei Adoshem
lirtzonchem. When the man was given there

1656
02:16:31,416 --> 02:16:35,353
was not...the people had no say how

1657
02:16:35,353 --> 02:16:36,621
it should be collected.

1658
02:16:36,621 --> 02:16:42,594
Here, after the hashgacha pratis, the
special hashgacha pratis of Mitzrayim came

1659
02:16:42,594 --> 02:16:45,697
to an end, in life you will be free to

1660
02:16:45,697 --> 02:16:47,265
do many things.

1661
02:16:47,732 --> 02:16:50,001
It will be lirtzonchem, mimochoras

1662
02:16:50,001 --> 02:16:52,804
haShabbos yenifenu hakohen.

1663
02:16:54,005 --> 02:16:56,942
Veasisem beyom hanifchem
es haomer keves ben shnaso.

1664
02:16:57,342 --> 02:17:02,047
So is the sefiras haomer and
the korban haomer, the minchas

1665
02:17:02,047 --> 02:17:10,522
haomer, are indicative of the tremendous
change which Knesses Yisrael experienced

1666
02:17:10,522 --> 02:17:15,894
when they had to change and bizman,
later in the times of Yehoshua, when

1667
02:17:15,894 --> 02:17:21,466
they had to change from a nation which
was under the exclusive control of

1668
02:17:21,466 --> 02:17:30,075
Hakadosh Baruch Hu and who was, actually

1669
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:33,979
experienced His presence on every step.

1670
02:17:33,979 --> 02:17:41,253
And a people come to a land and they
are told to cultivate the land and

1671
02:17:41,253 --> 02:17:47,626
to establish a government and to rule
themselves decently in accordance with

1672
02:17:47,626 --> 02:17:51,296
laws, with the dinei haTorah, which

1673
02:17:51,296 --> 02:17:54,366
are interested mainly in

1674
02:17:54,366 --> 02:18:02,807
the hashgacha lemata miderech hateva.

1675
02:18:03,174 --> 02:18:09,214
The simple hashgacha, the cosmic order
which was established in Bereishis bara

1676
02:18:09,214 --> 02:18:10,815
Elokim es hashamayim ve'es ha'aretz.

1677
02:18:10,815 --> 02:18:12,083
This order.

1678
02:18:13,852 --> 02:18:17,589
Not the order for nissim
and niflaos exclusively.

1679
02:18:19,157 --> 02:18:23,895
In this order is the [inaudible],
and this is the omer, this is the

1680
02:18:23,895 --> 02:18:32,003
korban, the korban of, that the
people used to bring erev Pesach.

1681
02:18:32,003 --> 02:18:37,309
The first day of Pesach was completely,
completely dedicated, even ledoros,

1682
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:42,781
even nowadays, the first night of
Pesach of Seder is dedicated to what?

1683
02:18:42,781 --> 02:18:44,516
what is it dedicated?

1684
02:18:45,150 --> 02:18:49,120
Lema'ala miderech hateva.

1685
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,223
Matzah, maror, (inaudible).

1686
02:18:52,223 --> 02:18:59,564
We do, uveosos uvemofsim, [more
citations from the Haggadah].

1687
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:01,599
And we have a list, we have

1688
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:02,867
a list in the

1689
02:19:02,867 --> 02:19:10,642
Dayeinu ... when we say it means
all the nissim which are expressed

1690
02:19:10,642 --> 02:19:12,043
in lema'ala miderech hateva.

1691
02:19:12,544 --> 02:19:13,645
Expressed in the

1692
02:19:13,645 --> 02:19:16,348
list of the nissim which
Hakadosh Baruch Hu did to us.

1693
02:19:16,948 --> 02:19:18,416
This is the omer.

1694
02:19:18,883 --> 02:19:20,919
This is the korban haomer.

1695
02:19:22,287 --> 02:19:30,028
That's why we are not close to Hakadosh
Baruch Hu [inaudible] too close.

1696
02:19:30,028 --> 02:19:30,729
We are not

1697
02:19:30,729 --> 02:19:36,134
as close as our ancestors whose
story is told in the Bible.

1698
02:19:36,134 --> 02:19:37,635
But that's why

1699
02:19:37,635 --> 02:19:43,842
we deserve, we deserve chesed, patience
on the part of Hakadosh Baruch Hu.

1700
02:19:44,209 --> 02:19:49,214
Because when our ancestors met
Hakadosh Baruch Hu, they were

1701
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:52,183
much closer to him than we are.

1702
02:19:52,584 --> 02:19:54,919
They spoke with Hakadosh Baruch
Hu, there was gilui Shechinah

1703
02:19:54,919 --> 02:19:59,557
on a personal level, there was
gilui Shechinah on a higher level.

1704
02:19:59,924 --> 02:20:03,094
But they had the perception
of Hakadosh Baruch Hu.

1705
02:20:03,495 --> 02:20:05,330
We are not as close to

1706
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:07,699
Him as our avoseinu.

1707
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:14,839
But there is something compensating,
namely He is not as swift

1708
02:20:14,839 --> 02:20:17,008
and quick with punishment.

1709
02:20:17,008 --> 02:20:20,812
Vead yom moso tichakeh lo,
im yashuv miyad tekablo.

1710
02:20:20,812 --> 02:20:22,580
Alright.
