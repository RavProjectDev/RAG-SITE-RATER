1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:04,504
I don't know; I'm a newcomer here
and I would like to know what

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,340
is it? Is this a lecture or a seminar?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,608
I would like to understand it better.

4
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:09,976
If you could explain it to me.

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,481
More like a symposium, a
discussion or a lecture?

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,750
I mean it depends upon you.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,686
Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,223
It's a combination.

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,891
Let me, I will

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,327
perhaps make a compromise 

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:31,331
that I would lecture but
you have a right – and I would rather

12
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,869
appreciate – if you would interrupt my
lecture in case you have a question about it.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,038
This is my policy.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,306
I’ve been a teacher for many, many years.

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,241
My policy is

16
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:45,545
that the students interrupt me if
they want to ask me a question.

17
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,651
So I would appreciate if you should
interrupt me if something is not clear or

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,653
you have a question or if you

19
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,988
disagree with me.

20
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,590
Philosophy of religion has many levels.

21
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,494
Modern philosophy of religion,
comparative philosophy of religion,

22
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:08,168
medieval philosophers, Jewish and
Christian, and so forth, and so on.

23
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,305
My training basically was not
in the field of philosophy of

24
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,374
religion, but philosophy of science.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,843
Something new that came to philosophy.

26
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,613
But perhaps I have a strange
approach to philosophy of religion.

27
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:26,386
As my training was not a theological
one or exclusively

28
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,155
in the field of philosophy of
religion, of religious thought.

29
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:37,330
However, I have been, so to say,
testing or thrusting, using an

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,101
expression by Heidegger, into a
certain environment where philosophy

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,136
of religion was considered important.

32
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:48,641
So I started to… I tried to interpret it
– Jewish religious concepts – 

33
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,111
in philosophical terms.

34
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:56,816
To tell you that I know much
about it, I would not be sincere.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,719
Basically, I am very perplexed, 

36
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,355
perhaps as perplexed as 
anybody else and more.

37
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,961
And I don’t believe that
Judaism is a philosophy

38
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,564
or is a religion which has many
answers, like the Catholic philosophy.

39
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,902
Judaism has many problems but
very few answers, very few.

40
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,038
And perhaps the more I
lecture, the more perplexed

41
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,041
you will be and the more, I would
say, confused, instead of clearing

42
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,880
up some problems in your mind.

43
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,917
But it is good if you can see a problem

44
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,652
 and to understand the 
problem is insoluble,

45
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:39,425
and actually Maimonides says that to be
perplexed does not mean to be confused.

46
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:49,903
And whatever I will say, I
am not laying claim to any

47
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:54,474
theoretical or cognitive validity.

48
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,545
I don’t know whether what I’m
going to say is true or not.

49
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,479
It’s hard to say.

50
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,784
We don’t have criteria by which objectively
to judge our opinions about Judaism.

51
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,620
We have no laboratory, we have no tests.

52
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,693
The empirical approach we have is
just, I wouldn’t say has developed

53
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,562
as in the field of positive sciences.

54
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,799
All I will say to you is just
my own subjective thoughts

55
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,167
and feelings about Judaism.

56
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,971
I have tried to interpret
Judaism in modern terms,

57
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,841
for the Jew in his encounter
with the modern world.

58
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,143
I’ve tried very hard.

59
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,247
But it’s always subjective
experience and a subjective

60
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,516
interpretation on my part.

61
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,152
I am not out to convert anybody.

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,288
I am not carrying the gospel of Judaism.

63
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,891
I lack missionary zeal.

64
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:57,470
Whatever I will do, take it as an
act of confidence on my part, of,

65
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,908
as confessing, or rather letting
you share my own subjective

66
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,310
experience, my own private experience.

67
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,048
If you should find that my experience
and yours, there is some commensurability

68
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:13,753
between your feelings and my
experience, my efforts will be rewarded.

69
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,091
However, if you should find that my
experience and your experience are

70
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:24,864
incommensurable, incongruous, and
you disagree with me totally, I will

71
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,965
not feel hurt.

72
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,969
For it’s very hard to find
commensurability between private,

73
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:35,074
between private experiences
of two different individuals.

74
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,445
With the trait of uniqueness,
actually, excludes commensurability.

75
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:47,620
In general, whenever, whoever speaks about
Judaism and makes an authoritative

76
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,491
statement, I don’t believe – I’m not
saying about Jewish law, but about

77
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,559
Jewish philosophy – he is wrong.

78
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,696
It’s just a subjective interpretation.

79
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:03,269
We have no authority to determine
which philosophy is a perennial

80
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,739
Jewish philosophy, and which
one is just a modern, transient

81
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,042
interpretation of Judaism.

82
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,848
Now, I believe that the topic of
our lectures will deal with man and

83
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,650
his social institutions he created.

84
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,088
But today I wouldn’t speak about
man, I’ll just give an introduction

85
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,459
as to the methodology of Judaism and
how we can approach this problem.

86
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,497
Judaism has a doctrine of man.

87
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,769
Because if it has no doctrine of
man, so we could get up and go home.

88
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:42,942
As a matter of fact, such a doctrine
underlies every civilized religion.

89
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,980
Any civilized religion, not only
Judaism, Christianity and Islam,

90
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,483
must have a doctrine of man.

91
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,620
Since religion is concerned with
the relationship – with the triple

92
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,890
relationship – of God, man, and the
world [this is the basic relationship

93
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,496
in any philosophy of religion] it must
necessarily possess some knowledge on

94
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:09,869
the one hand of God’s infinite will,
which conveys to man the moral law and

95
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:15,508
the means by which this moral law is
to be realized, and on the other hand

96
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:20,980
of man himself, the subject of the good
religious conduct and the ethical norms.

97
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,519
Now let me add something.

98
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:33,393
Cognition or knowledge is one of
the main motifs which determine

99
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,728
and shape the religious experience.

100
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,432
The homo religiosus,

101
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,569
in technical terms, means a
man of religious experience.

102
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:48,641
The homo religiosus is engaged
in a cognitive gesture.

103
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,445
He is basically a theoretical man.

104
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,380
The homo theoreticus,

105
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,315
or anthropos theoreticus.

106
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:03,623
The intellectual urge is as
potent in him as it is in the

107
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,926
homo theoreticus.

108
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:15,368
Curiosity prompts both the homo religiosus
and the homo theoreticus to face the world

109
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:20,173
and man in an inquisitive mood of inquiry.

110
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:27,013
I am saying that because many
theorists in the history of philosophy

111
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:32,251
of religion have maintained that
religion is not a cognitive gesture.

112
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:38,991
Either Schleiermacher, who wanted
us to believe in emotional gesture

113
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:49,702
and the main experience of the homo
religiosus can be reduced to the

114
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,805
feeling of absolute dependence.

115
00:07:52,805 --> 00:08:00,246
Or as Kant and the Neo-Kantian school
maintained, the religious experience is

116
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:07,653
an ethical one, a moral experience, the
experience of the absolute imperative.

117
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:17,396
So Schleiermacher sentimentalized
religion, Kant ethicized it.

118
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:24,904
Both of them have eliminated the
intellectual urge of the homo religiosus.

119
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:30,910
The homo religiosus doesn’t want to know,
but he wants to act, says Kant.

120
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,381
Schleiermacher said, the homo
religiosus doesn’t want to

121
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,416
know, nor does he want to act.

122
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,352
He feels something.

123
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,988
He is emotionally unique.

124
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:50,263
However, intellectually, volitionally,
ethically, morally, there is no uniqueness

125
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,265
to him, no singularity.

126
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,369
However, it’s impossible
to maintain this attitude,

127
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,704
particularly in modern religion.

128
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,679
The religious experience has basic,
central, intellectual, or cognitive motifs.

129
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,920
Like the homo theoreticus, whoever
he is – scientist, psychologist,

130
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,525
philosopher – the religious person is
a person who seeks knowledge.

131
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,429
Of course,

132
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:31,604
the objectives and hence the methods
of the homo religiosus and the

133
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,140
homo theoreticus are different.

134
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,375
They vary.

135
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:44,050
The homo theoreticus studies a
reality bounded in by finitude.

136
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,051
That’s all.

137
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,020
He does not know of any other reality.

138
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:56,462
Finitude and reality are identical for
him, whose multifarious complexities are

139
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:04,103
reduced, or can be reduced, to relational,
formal, mathematical equations, and to a

140
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,841
system of a dynamic interdependence,

141
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:15,381
whose rationale, the rationale of
reality – and science must believe

142
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,684
in the rationale of reality, because
otherwise the scientist would never

143
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,054
approach reality in a confident mood.

144
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:27,526
There is a rationale in reality
whose rationale manifests

145
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:33,399
itself in expressibility and
technological applicability.

146
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,337
This is the approach on the part
of the scientist to reality.

147
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:44,977
The homo religiosus explores
being at a different level.

148
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,647
Not so much for the sake of

149
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:57,423
discovering the here and now knowable,
explainable, and useful aspects.

150
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:04,530
He’s also interested in that, but his main
interest centers on something else.

151
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,539
He is not so much interested in the

152
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:22,281
knowledge of reality which is accessible
to us, but he is more interested in

153
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:28,421
transcending the charted lanes of an
orderly and neatly arranged cosmos

154
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:36,595
or universe, and venturing into
into the unknown, into remote, empty

155
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:45,304
distances and boundless stretches,
into a strange and puzzling and

156
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,075
baffling world, which can neither be

157
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:59,418
mathematized nor interpreted in
abstract constructs and concepts.

158
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:08,728
Because for the homo theoreticus, the total equation of the universe is knowable.

159
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,466
Of course, if the universe were not

160
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:18,671
knowable, comprehensible, there
would be actually a gesture of

161
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,074
resignation on the part of the
scientist or the homo theoreticus.

162
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,378
The equation, the total
equation of the homo religiosus

163
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,018
says “existence is a paradoxical affair,

164
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:42,862
a mysterium magnum, which
inspires in the man awe and tremor”.

165
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:52,805
Of course, ladies and gentlemen, in order
to arrive at such an absurd equation,

166
00:12:54,473 --> 00:13:02,047
or if I may use Kierkegaard’s expression,
to perform the movement of resignation

167
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:11,123
which is basic for the homo religiosus,
homo religiosus must resign from

168
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:16,862
time to time in order to perform
the act or the movement of complete

169
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:24,804
resignation, the homo religiosus must
explore every nook and corner of reality;

170
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:33,412
examine, search every aspect of
being, and try to interpret even

171
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,614
the minutest process in reality.

172
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:43,722
Because the act of resignation on
the part of the homo religiosus is

173
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:50,930
not to be equated with the naivete
of the uninitiated, ignorant person

174
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:58,537
who denies the worth of knowledge
because he doesn’t know anything.

175
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,739
Not to be equated.

176
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:08,013
Whoever the homo religiosus is, he must
not be an ignorant person, nor must he be

177
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,415
an arrogant person.

178
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:16,155
Ignorance and arrogance are certain traits
which are completely, are strange to

179
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,058
the religious experience, incommensurate

180
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,227
with the religious awareness.

181
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:29,168
This skepticism which flows from an
arrogant attitude

182
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,670
is alien to the homo religiosus.

183
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,346
The act of resignation on the part of the
homo religiosus is rather to be compared

184
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,617
with the skepsis of the Ecclesiastes,

185
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,588
or the despair of Faust by Goethe,

186
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:55,394
who because of having
attained great intellectual heights,

187
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:01,233
because of their incessant drinking
from the fountainhead of wisdom

188
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:11,210
and their mastery of the cognitive
gesture and their insatiable curiosity,

189
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:18,584
have arrived at the conclusion that
being is an insoluble equation.

190
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:25,157
But it is a resignation which
follows knowledge and completes

191
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:30,829
the act of knowing, not an act of
resignation which precludes knowledge.

192
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,500
Because to resign before one
knows is not resignation.

193
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,568
This is arrogance and ignorance.

194
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,543
Of course, only the mathematician
can prove that certain

195
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,312
equations are insoluble.

196
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,716
A person who is not initiated in
mathematics cannot prove that.

197
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:58,924
And the homo religiosus is the
mathematician who tries to prove,

198
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:04,330
who feels that the total equation
of reality is an insoluble one.

199
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,699
Perhaps a great mystery.

200
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,471
But he is a man of knowledge.

201
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,773
He is an intellectual.

202
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,476
He is driven by the so-called,

203
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,881
if I may use a Kantian expression,
the metaphysical impulse.

204
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,017
He wants to know.

205
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,689
Not only wants to act, not only he
feels differently, he wants to know.

206
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,927
And of course the homo religiosus knows

207
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:41,266
of and is concerned with and is
guided by and exists by existential

208
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:46,972
purposes which surpass the
boundary lines of finitude, true.

209
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,876
He is also in another respect
different from the scientist.

210
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:56,749
The scientist studies only reality
which is bounded in by finitude, by the

211
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,752
frames of reference of time and space.

212
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,956
However, the homo religiosus knows
of another existence – I wouldn’t say

213
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:08,027
another existence because this would
sound a little too theological – but of an

214
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:16,535
existence which transcends the boundaries
of finitude and the boundaries of finitude

215
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,571
which is conditioned by temporality.

216
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:27,679
Yet, irrespective of the ultimate
end which religion pursues, and

217
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,520
which is above and outside the
worldly ambitions and aspirations of

218
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,994
the homo theoreticus, irrespective
of that, the drama of religion

219
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:49,101
unfolds only within the confines of
our natural orders, it means within

220
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,271
the confines of this worldliness.

221
00:17:53,505 --> 00:18:00,212
Right here and now – and this is basically
Jewish – Right here and now, in a

222
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:04,483
world of sound and color, of sensuous

223
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:13,392
complexities, of change and development,
of mechanical motion and unalterable

224
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:20,566
processes, the homo man has his
rendezvous with infinity, with God.

225
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:26,038
In order to meet God, one does not
have to transcend this world, although,

226
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,740
perhaps, he knows of a higher existence.

227
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,645
But meeting God, and this is basically
Jewish – Perhaps Christianity will

228
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,217
disagree, I would say medieval
Christianity in this respect, we

229
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,987
will come later to this point, we
will return to this point – the

230
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:48,827
Jewish opinion always said that
one meets God right here and now,

231
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:54,166
within the confines of time and space.

232
00:18:54,166 --> 00:19:00,506
Here and now, in the midst of the
event of a world of events and things,

233
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:09,114
of mechanical orders, man rises to
great heights and meets his creator,

234
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:17,156
and he also falls into bottomless abyss of

235
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,493
sin and actually inferior existence.

236
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:28,467
Right here and now, he rebels
against God and His authority which

237
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,136
he accepted prior to his rebellion.

238
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:37,042
And right here and now, he returns
to God meekly and humbly, like a

239
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:43,248
child who apologizes to his father
against whom he rebelled a while ago.

240
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,685
But it’s in the right
here and now reality.

241
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,793
Right here and now, man struggles
with absurdity and insensateness and

242
00:19:54,793 --> 00:20:02,167
tries to infuse meaning into something
unknown which we call existence.

243
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:12,511
If, of course gentlemen, theater
of religious activities, of self,

244
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:18,784
of religious self-expression and
self-realization is to be found here in

245
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:25,290
our sensuous world, then understanding
of and acquaintanceship with the latter

246
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:33,198
– with this world – is a conditio sine qua
non for the proper guiding, for the proper

247
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,435
realization of our religious destiny.

248
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,770
So it means, what I wanted to say,

249
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:47,012
is that religion lays claims to knowledge;
and this knowledge does not pertain

250
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:54,019
to eternity or to some transcendental
entities or to some spiritual beings,

251
00:20:54,853 --> 00:21:01,493
but religion wants to know this world,
this corporeal, sensuous world in all

252
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:07,132
its manifestations and at all its levels.

253
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,903
Like the scientist or
the homo theoreticus.

254
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:19,711
And of course, ladies and
gentlemen, it is a truism that

255
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:28,020
although the cognitive gesture of the homo
religiosus is a comprehensive one, aiming

256
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:38,563
at reality in its entirety, manifesting
itself in a variety of orders, the homo

257
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:45,937
religiosus is mainly concerned with the
order of personal existence.

258
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,876
Or to be more exact, with himself.

259
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,478
Of course, he wants to
know the world, certainly.

260
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,414
No doubt about it.

261
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,184
But he is more concerned with himself.

262
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:04,089
Perhaps there is a distinction between the
homo theoreticus and the homo religiosus.

263
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,993
The homo theoreticus until
recently, actually, was more

264
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,431
concerned with the outside world,
with the physical processes, with

265
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,301
motion, since the days of Thales.

266
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:24,476
He was more concerned with organic matter,
with the process of life, which

267
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,212
also belongs to the outside world.

268
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,215
He was less concerned with
himself, the scientist.

269
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,252
Because simply, if the scientist had
been concerned with himself as much

270
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:39,257
as he was concerned with the outside
world, with dead matter and inanimate

271
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,261
matter, then perhaps psychology
and sociology, all the humanities

272
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,598
would have progressed much more.

273
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:53,071
Because actually, knowledge of man is
a latecomer in the history of science.

274
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,607
It’s a newcomer actually.

275
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,441
All right.

276
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,176
In the history of philosophy, you know,

277
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,011
Socrates said, what is man?

278
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,347
But it was a different approach.

279
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,349
It was not knowledge,
theoretical knowledge.

280
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,752
It was more a practical problem.

281
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,421
What should man do in order to be happy?

282
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,356
This was the general problem
of the Greek philosophers.

283
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:17,996
Not who is man, what is man, what is
the existential experience, what kind of

284
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:22,801
a being he is, what is his uniqueness,
singularity, his station in the world,

285
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,305
in the universe, his struggle with the
outside world and struggle with himself.

286
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,443
No, this was not a problem of Socrates,
nor was it the problem of Aristotle or

287
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:36,281
his master Plato, nor was it the problem
of the Stoics and the Epicurean school.

288
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:40,085
The problem was a practical one, a
pragmatic one, a functional problem.

289
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,087
How can men be happy?

290
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:46,958
How can they attain eudaimonia or
what they called it pleasure, hedone?

291
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,393
It’s a practical problem.

292
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,598
And the whole discussion about man
in Greek philosophy, in the late

293
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:59,237
antiquity, in the Greek philosophy
from Socrates on down, so it did not

294
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:03,141
revolve about the metaphysic of man or
theory of man, it was more revolving

295
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,744
about the practical discipline of man.

296
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,978
How can man be happy?

297
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,482
It’s a technological problem about
man, not a theoretical problem.

298
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:15,153
And you know very well that
technological problems cannot be

299
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,289
solved unless you do basic research.

300
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,092
And this was the trouble with
the Greek philosophers.

301
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:27,199
When it came to the outside
world, they were pure theoreticians.

302
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,403
The pragmatic view absolutely
did not interest them at all.

303
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,140
They wanted to understand
for the sake of knowledge.

304
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,680
Of course, you know, the idea of
technology was alien to the Greek.

305
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,916
Completely alien, because
the type of knowledge he was

306
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:50,822
pursuing did not lend itself
to technological application.

307
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:59,331
However, when it came to man himself,
he suddenly turned into a technician.

308
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,835
Not who is man, what is man, but how
should man act in order to be happy.

309
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,106
And of course, the homo
religiosus is concerned with

310
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,208
man, and he has a double problem.

311
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:15,647
Who is man, and also the old Greek
problem, the pragmatic problem,

312
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,250
what shall a man do in order

313
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,219
to find self-fulfillment.

314
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:28,093
Religion must possess intimate
knowledge and understanding at all

315
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:34,900
levels of the existential experience
or what you call self-awareness.

316
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,641
Otherwise, the God-man relationship could
remain an enigma to the homo religiosus.

317
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:48,346
If he doesn’t understand
himself, how can he approach God?

318
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,189
However

319
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:06,932
universally true the aforementioned
maxim is, that the homo religiosus is

320
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:12,304
an intellectual type and is particularly
interested in self-knowledge, it is

321
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:19,010
true, various religions differ as to
the manner in which they emphasize

322
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,748
the above-mentioned cognitive
aspects of the homo religiosus.

323
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,788
While

324
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:37,562
most religious systems, and I am speaking,
when I say most religious systems, I

325
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,065
am referring to occidental religion.

326
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,100
I have very little knowledge
of oriental religion.

327
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,736
I have no right to speak,
not even to mention it.

328
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,406
Occidental religion I understand,
Christianity and Islam.

329
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,813
I am quite well acquainted with
Christian scholastics, modern. 

330
00:26:55,246 --> 00:27:05,457
Most religious systems were more prone to
theological thinking and developed

331
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:12,797
theosophic doctrines, focusing their
attention upon transcendental reality.

332
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:20,639
And they developed only latent
religious anthropologies.

333
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,476
I mean, to distinguish it from
scientific anthropology, we

334
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,877
call religious anthropology.

335
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,180
When I say religious anthropology,
it means the metaphysic of

336
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,019
man, the interpretation of
man formulated in religious terms.

337
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:41,660
For instance, in Christianity, they have
a social philosophy, no doubt about it.

338
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,298
Thomas Aquinas developed quite an
extensive social philosophy based upon

339
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,301
natural law, lex naturalis or lex naturae.

340
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,372
But however, it’s funny, it’s strange,
they developed a social philosophy

341
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,042
without inquiring into the essence of man.

342
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:03,648
How can you develop a social philosophy
before you inquire into man for himself

343
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,853
– regardless of the controversies about
the relationship between man for

344
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,423
himself and man within the community,

345
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,426
we will come later to this problem,
this controvery. 

346
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,062
Whether the community perceives the
individual or the individual perceives

347
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:22,000
the community, I mean systematically,
conceptually – but however, Thomas Aquinas

348
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,038
was not concerned with the problem “who
is man?”, he was concerned “what is

349
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,578
society?” And that is the reason why
social philosophy is incomplete, because

350
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:42,287
it lacks the basic premise: knowledge
of man for himself, man in seclusion,

351
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:50,729
man communing not with the other
self, but man communing with himself.

352
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:56,568
That, only lately, Christian
philosophy began to develop.

353
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:04,309
And actually this aspect of religious
anthropology dealing with the individual.

354
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:09,147
And of course, this is what we know,
what’s known to us under the name or

355
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:13,384
the title religious existentialism,
where there are many books written

356
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,320
about religious existentialism.

357
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,855
What it is?

358
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:22,393
It means the philosophy of
man, interpreted in terms

359
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,129
of religious experience.

360
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:28,566
That is exactly, more or less, if we
want to simplify this equation.

361
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,571
However, Judaism

362
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,008
occupied a very unique

363
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:43,214
position in the world of religion.

364
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:53,491
While other religions stressed the
idea of God more than that of man,

365
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:58,863
Judaism, in its intellectual pursuits,

366
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,866
concentrated on man.

367
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:09,174
And religious anthropology
replaced, in Judaism, theology.

368
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:21,052
We have always inquired into the essence
of man, never into the essence of God.

369
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:30,361
Hence, our world formula
is quite paradoxical.

370
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,164
It is theocentric,

371
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,334
God-centered, theocentric.

372
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,804
However, anthropo-oriented.

373
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,140
We are orientated on man.

374
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:50,048
We concentrate more teleologically on
God: of course, God is the beginning

375
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,619
and the ultimate end of everything
– Judaism maintains that as any other

376
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,423
civilized religion – because if He's
not the beginning and the end of

377
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,091
everything, there's no need for religion.

378
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,028
I can never understand a religion
which becomes so modernized that

379
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,697
the idea of God is eliminated.

380
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:13,271
Not that the zeal or the fanaticism
makes me rebel against it, but a

381
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:19,644
simple question: if this is religion,
so there is no need to spend so

382
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,279
much money on its institutions.

383
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:28,486
We were, of course, we are
theocentric, but anthropo-orientated.

384
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,891
Of course, God is the beginning
and the ultimate end of everything.

385
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:38,563
In Him, the fullness of existence
is realized and all yearnings

386
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,065
of man find fulfillment.

387
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,967
No doubt about it.

388
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:48,673
It's very important for the
therapeutic aspect of religion.

389
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:56,014
Yet God Himself, creator of the world,
out of whose pure absolute, infinite

390
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:04,956
being, finitude emerged, God Himself
remains to us Jews, keil mistater

391
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:12,263
beshafrir chevyon: Deus absconditus,
a mysterium tremendum, a hidden God.

392
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:20,972
Inapproachable, unknowable, inexpressible, eluding the grasp of our concepts. 

393
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,543
And if you allow me, I want here to just

394
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:35,453
call your attention to one
dichotomy, or rather to an antithesis

395
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,422
in our religious experience.

396
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:42,126
Our experience of God, the Judaic
experience of God – of course, I mean,

397
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,728
you will find it in other religions as

398
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:48,599
well, but particularly the Judaic
experience of God – is antithetic,

399
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:56,407
insofar it contains an awareness
of both: of endless remoteness

400
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:01,612
and mystery on one hand, and
of intimate closeness and

401
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,381
familiarity on the other hand.

402
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,083
Don't ask me how

403
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:13,891
it is possible, because basically
Judaism, in its approach to God, did not

404
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:19,530
operate with the Aristotelian two-valued
logic, or with the famous principle of

405
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,033
contradiction or the excluded middle.

406
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:27,105
Aristotle said, if it is A, it cannot
be at the same time B. If it is B,

407
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,675
it cannot be at the same time A.
It's either A or B. And if it's A

408
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,443
or B, it cannot be something else.

409
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:38,049
We say, we Jews say, typical of
our mentality, it can be A and

410
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,053
at the same time B. And not only
it can be A at the same time B, it

411
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:48,292
can be A and at the same time B and
also something else than A and B.

412
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,865
I mean, you know, ladies and
gentlemen, modern physics,

413
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,967
classical physics operate with it.

414
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,738
For instance, you know, the theory
of light is interpreted nowadays

415
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,943
both in terms of waves and in
terms of particles, although both

416
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,246
theories are mutually exclusive.

417
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,819
So perhaps actually the modern advanced
mathematics and advanced physics

418
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:21,759
cannot operate simply, the mass of
phenomena does not lend itself to a

419
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,263
two-valued logical interpretation.

420
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:32,770
The principle of contradiction and the
principle of the excluded middle

421
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,908
was thrown away by the scientists.

422
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:42,713
But in the religious approach,
it's certainly that we operate

423
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:47,251
with antithetic ideas, concepts.

424
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:53,825
On one hand, He is remote, on
the other hand, He is close.

425
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:00,498
In our encounter with God, we
find ourselves, many a time,

426
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:07,138
bewildered by the opposition of
two experiential alternatives.

427
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,774
First, as I said before,

428
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:14,579
Deus absconditus,
God who is hiding in the depths

429
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,247
of infinity and eternity.

430
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:22,520
And second, as the Psalmist
says, karov Hashem lechol kor'av.

431
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:29,060
The Lord is nigh unto all that
call upon Him, to all that call

432
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,062
upon Him in truth and sincerity.

433
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:36,300
He is both: He is nigh and
remote, He is near and far away.

434
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,903
This is the Jewish experience of God.

435
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,275
On the one hand, we experience God
as dwelling apart and beyond all

436
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:49,514
dimensions of being, hidden in the
remotest recesses of infinity, is

437
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:56,254
unapproachable and incomprehensible,
abiding in concealment, and in

438
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,156
the shadows of transcendence.

439
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:05,663
And the Hebrew word kadosh, holy;
whoever knows the etymological meaning

440
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:11,235
of kadosh, you know that kadosh actually
in Hebrew signifies separateness,

441
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,572
difference, otherness, incommensurability.

442
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:18,643
Something which doesn't
belong into this order.

443
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,112
Something mysterious.

444
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:26,484
It signifies the
withdrawal of God from me.

445
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,286
On the other hand, 

446
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:34,292
the homo religiosus feels
also the immediate presence of God – His

447
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:42,600
endless remoteness and also the immediate
presence of God – outside and within him.

448
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:47,271
God is man's haven, if you
will, his fortress, his

449
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,007
habitation, where man resides.

450
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,976
He experiences God

451
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,179
as his companion,
father, mother, friend.

452
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,216
The words I'm quoting I
take it from the Bible.

453
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,319
The Bible is a book of the
Judaic religious experience.

454
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,755
Mother, friend, lover and
beloved, both together.

455
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:11,195
Who caresses his head, bent under
the load of existence, and whispers

456
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,431
words of condolence 
and hope to him. 

457
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,767
He is the shepherd who

458
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:25,376
cares for the helpless and the weak
and carries the young in his bosom.

459
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,678
This is a quotation from Isaiah.

460
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:35,386
On the one hand, Deus absconditus, on the
other hand, Deus revelatus, close God.

461
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,191
On one hand, mysterium 
tremendum, magnum,

462
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,561
distant, strange, unknowable, inspiring

463
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:49,500
dread and awe, and on the other hand, Deus
revelatus, involved in creation, in every

464
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,538
aspect of existence, addressing Himself
to us through every twinkle of a distant

465
00:37:54,538 --> 00:38:00,811
star, through every budding tree, out of
the stillness of a summer night, the cry

466
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,082
of the infant, and the innocent laughter
of the child, through warm thought,

467
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,518
feeling, strivings, and yearnings.

468
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:13,157
And on the other hand, distant,
incomprehensible, strange,

469
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,994
far in infinity, in

470
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,363
the recesses of infinity.

471
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:26,671
He confronts us both as an adversary, as

472
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:30,107
an antagonist, and as a friend.

473
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,411
As a stranger, and as a father.

474
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:39,216
As a familiar figure, if I may use this
expression, and as a mysterious power.

475
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:44,722
You know, Jacob, who was
wrestling with the stranger.

476
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,791
Who was the stranger?

477
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,461
If not the same God who spoke
to him the night before.

478
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,334
The experience is
antithetic, is dichotomous.

479
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:04,075
It's mutually exclusive, but still
these antitheses and this dichotomy

480
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:09,647
actually lend to the religious
experience its uniqueness, greatness, and

481
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,682
magnificence.

482
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:18,422
But of course, we must realize, keep
in mind, that while the individual homo

483
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:24,829
religiosus may engage in a paradoxical
experience – fraught with incommensurate

484
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,566
aspects and incongruous themes,

485
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:34,038
oscillating between complete
resignation and passionate,

486
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,475
ecstatic joy – the community,

487
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:45,983
the institutionalized religion must
organize its collective experience

488
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:51,722
along coherent patterns, and
cannot afford to tolerate polarity

489
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,959
within our religious awareness.

490
00:39:55,292 --> 00:40:01,866
What is good at an esoteric
level is absolutely inoperative

491
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,804
at an exoteric level.

492
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,905
What is good for

493
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:13,310
the few individuals, for the
homines religiosi, for the great

494
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:19,817
religious genius, is absolutely
incomprehensible for the average person.

495
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,320
So of course, therefore, if you,
for instance, study the history

496
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:29,894
of religion, you will find that
some religions have emphasized the

497
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,563
aspect of remoteness of God.

498
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:38,369
And other religions on
the contrary, introduced God as familiar.

499
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:43,741
Although the religious experience,
the private religious experience

500
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:49,146
of the homo religiosus has both
motifs: the motif of remoteness

501
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,951
and the motif of closeness as well.

502
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,053
 For instance, you take Christianity.

503
00:40:56,053 --> 00:41:00,024
Why was the concept of Father/Son introduced?

504
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,294
Why?

505
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,165
Why was this Trinitarian motif introduced in Christianity?

506
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:12,303
Philosophically, simply, I mean, whoever
reads the literature of the Fathers

507
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,308
of the Desert or read the literature

508
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,512
of Saint by Saint Augustine, his
confessions, his God, and so forth and

509
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:27,751
on, will see that Christianity actually
was torn by two motifs: by the motif of

510
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,688
closeness to God and remoteness to God.

511
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,758
By the motif of Deus absconditus,
the hidden God, and by the motif

512
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,028
of Deus revelatus, the revealed
God, the one that is close to

513
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:42,399
me, who is within me, who has
intercourse with me, who is my

514
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:47,271
companion, to whom I can address
myself, I can pray, I can complain, I

515
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:52,176
may rebel, I may engage in a dialogue.

516
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:59,350
And the final result was that God the
Father is the remote one, and the Son

517
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:06,323
is the one who was walking on earth,
associating with people, speaking to them.

518
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:10,361
That's why in Christianity, in Christian
theology, you know very well, all

519
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:17,034
prayers cannot be addressed to the
Father unless we beseech the Son to

520
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,869
mediate between us and the Father.

521
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,470
Why?

522
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,207
Because the Father is
too remote for prayer.

523
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,875
Prayer cannot reach Him.

524
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:30,180
There is no way for man to
find access to God the Father.

525
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:39,390
That's why they actually simply
split divinity into two entities

526
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,826
and introduced the Son, who is
the God who is close to him.

527
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,163
Judaism, a Unitarian
religion, couldn't do that.

528
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:53,270
So in Judaism, it is an antithesis, a
dichotomy of closeness and remoteness.

529
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,306
Yeah.

530
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,909
The question is, what did
Judaism do with the problem of

531
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,711
its institutionalized religion?

532
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,815
Judaism is a private experience, it's
also an institutionalized religion.

533
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,486
Any religion must be institutionalized
because the word religion itself

534
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,789
indicates institutionalization.

535
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:18,662
Institutionalized, conceptualized, made,
so to say, available to the crowds.

536
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:23,167
Because you cannot, you see– for instance,
education, there were times when education

537
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:31,709
was considered a privilege only of the
select few, of the aristocratic society.

538
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,777
England had such a system.

539
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,581
Actually all degrees, I mean,
actually believed in aristocracy

540
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,216
as far as education is concerned.

541
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:44,922
You can say art, Elliot says that art is
only a product of the class of leisure.

542
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,627
But no one can say that religion should be

543
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,097
so to say, limited to the select few.

544
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:58,836
For a simple reason: because from
our viewpoint, religion saves man,

545
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,071
gives him salvation and redemption.

546
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:05,776
And we think that everybody is
entitled to salvation and redemption,

547
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:10,047
not only the philosopher, but the
simpleton as well, not only the

548
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,617
aristocrat, but the slave as well.

549
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:19,123
So you cannot turn the religious
experience into an esoteric

550
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,759
affair for the philosopher,

551
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:28,966
for the inquiring mind, for the
person who simply encounters God.

552
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:34,538
Means and ways must be found in order
to simplify the religious experience

553
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,041
and to make it available and accessible

554
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,576
to every prayer.

555
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,345
And the dichotomous religious

556
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,948
experience is an esoteric affair.

557
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:51,789
Esoterically, the average person in the
street cannot understand the dichotomy.

558
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:52,589
It's either or, the

559
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,260
principle of contradiction that
Aristotle introduced into logic

560
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,662
is simply it's common sense.

561
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:02,399
It's either black or white, it cannot
be between, or gray, I mean, right?

562
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,469
It's either

563
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,507
the square or a circle, it
cannot be both at the same time.

564
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,143
So what did Judaism do?

565
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:17,481
What motif was emphasized not
in the private experience of God,

566
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,216
the Judaic private experience?

567
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:25,289
The Judaic private experience, as it was
depicted and described in the Psalms,

568
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,325
which is the greatest book on religious
experience in general, I believe,

569
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,994
and I am never apologetic about it.

570
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:34,631
But it is the greatest book of the
religious experience in general.

571
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,801
Everybody, I think, will agree
as far as this is concerned.

572
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:42,106
The Psalmist was a religious genius,
I mean, the real homo religiosus.

573
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:47,344
In him you find Psalms, the famous Psalm,
"God is my shepherd, I shall not want."

574
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,214
So how is God depicted, described there?

575
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,283
Close, companion, my shepherd.

576
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:58,155
I associate with him, I engage
in a dialogue with him, I bend my

577
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:04,061
tired head on his shoulder, and he
whispers into me words of hope, to me.

578
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,765
And the same Psalmist, the next
day, the next in the next chapter

579
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:12,770
begins to speak, begins to say,
"Where can I escape from you?

580
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,471
Where can I find you?

581
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,474
I have searched you everywhere.

582
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,176
I found you nowhere.

583
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,446
I came to your temple.

584
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:26,016
I thought I'll find you
there, but you are not there.

585
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:31,121
I searched in the woods, I
didn't find your shadow. Why?

586
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,826
On one hand he speaks of God as his
companion and shepherd, on the other

587
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:40,264
hand, in the same breath, he says he can't
find God, he doesn't know where He is.

588
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,100
It's what we call numinous
presence and numinous absence.

589
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,668
God is present and absent.
