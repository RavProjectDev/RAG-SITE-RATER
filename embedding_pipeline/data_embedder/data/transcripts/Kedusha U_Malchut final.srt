1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,873
It has been announced.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,442
Kedushah u'Malchus

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,845
Holiness and Kingship.

4
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:19,853
What I'm going to do tonight
is to investigate malchut as a

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:28,561
political institution, monarchy as
a political institution, and also as

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,830
a metaphysical, transcendental idea.

7
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:39,506
And we'll try to define the attitude
of Yahadus toward both,

8
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:44,911
monarchy as a political institution
and as a great ethical idea.

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,182
Malchut

10
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,085
is inseparably linked up

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,191
with the human quest for
companionship

12
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,061
and coexistence.

13
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,631
Human sociability

14
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:11,771
was decreed by the
Almighty at the dawn of creation.

15
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:21,414
When He, in His inscrutable
wisdom, proclaimed that

16
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:28,922
man -- that loneliness is bad for
man's growth and development, "Lo tov

17
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:38,798
heyos ha'adam levado." And in order
to redeem Man or Adam from his tragic

18
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:43,736
solitude, He created Eve to join him.

19
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:56,249
Indeed, man, because of fear of
loneliness, has displayed a remarkable

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:04,624
talent for setting up social entities
and linking up his individual

21
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,394
solitary life with other beings.

22
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,102
Developing thus a complex
system of human relations.

23
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:26,579
Within this framework of social
cross-reference and relatedness, man

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:36,489
tries to protect himself from the
curse of being alone or being nobody.

25
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:42,862
Whether he's successful in his quest for
togetherness is a different problem, which

26
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,497
I'm not going to investigate tonight.

27
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,901
However,

28
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,770
within the group,

29
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:57,310
which was formed in order
to help man free himself

30
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:04,050
from his loneliness,
there is no ideal equality

31
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:11,624
even though the constitution or
the covenant by which the group was

32
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:19,566
established or formed might rest upon
democratic and liberal foundations.

33
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:28,942
No matter how progressive a
particular society is and however

34
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:35,014
sincerely it tries to do away with
discrimination and class distinction,

35
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:45,758
its members can never attain
equality in the personal sense.

36
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,532
The reason for inequality within society,

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,270
which we endure as long as many of you roam

38
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:05,078
upon the face of the globe, lies
in the paradoxical nature of man in

39
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,047
his individuality and uniqueness.

40
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:19,292
Inequality is perhaps the shibboleth of
man, the most characteristic trait of

41
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:27,900
him, the prime mark of distinction and
differentiation from the subhuman world.

42
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:41,247
As Chazal describes, our Sages, there are
no two men, two people alike, both as

43
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:48,921
the physical appearance, countenance
and as to their spiritual personality.

44
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,529
"K'shem sh'partzufeihem shonim
kach dei'oseihem shonos."

45
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:10,343
Hence, success -- successful man, strong
man emerges on the top, becomes king

46
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:17,784
Frustrated man, weak man,
meek man turns into a subject.

47
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:26,559
In other words, the fear of
aloneness or loneliness and

48
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:31,964
the quest for togetherness,
coexistence and cooperation has

49
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:39,839
precipitated the formation of power
structures and power relationships.

50
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,717
I am departing from my text.

51
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,720
Reading the Megillah last Purim, 

52
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,590
I kept on thinking

53
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,693
I want to tell you; it did
not interfere with my kavanah.

54
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:12,605
I kept on thinking how little human power structures have changed.

55
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,743
Achashveirosh was a whimsical king,

56
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,547
a very irritable individual,

57
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,318
and quickly reached -- reaching decisions

58
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,653
on the spur of the moment.

59
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,689
Chazal, our

60
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,763
rabbis, said sarcastically of him, he
killed his beautiful queen, Vashti,

61
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:42,668
upon the advice of his best friend,
Memuchan, and later, he killed

62
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:47,173
his best friend upon the complaint
of his beautiful queen, Esther.

63
00:06:51,911 --> 00:07:00,119
We enjoy, if we read properly, the
element of comedy which is employed by

64
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,422
the Megillah in portraying Achashveirosh.

65
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:14,000
However, if our thoughts should cross
what's been approximately 24 centuries

66
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:21,741
from Galut Bavel -- from the end of
Galut Bavel to 1969, we realize that

67
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:26,946
the same whimsicality or irritability

68
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:34,787
on the part of an individual might
result not merely in the execution

69
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:44,096
of one person, of the prime
minister, but in an ugly, bloody war.

70
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:51,437
Or, in a brutal invasion of a
country, like Czechoslovakia.

71
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:59,111
Even -- it might result even
in the destruction of mankind.

72
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:04,050
A capricious president, and
every human being is capricious.

73
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:11,190
In a moment of anger and wrath, he may
push the button and precipitate

74
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,126
a nuclear confrontation.

75
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,431
This depends just upon
the whim of one man.

76
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,166
Of an individual.

77
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:31,577
And the vainglorious president of France,
in a moment of annoyance and anger,

78
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,414
which we are less justified than that of Achashveirosh, 

79
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,485
cut off the delivery of arms to a small nation,

80
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,389
which is fighting for its very existence.

81
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:50,730
I wonder indeed, how much has been
changed since the times of Achashveirosh.

82
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,336
Yahadut

83
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:08,581
has always been wary and very cautious of
political power structures and displayed

84
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:16,188
little tolerance for power concentrated
in the hands of an individual.

85
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:24,196
Well, of course, we had -- we were
compelled to reconcile ourselves with

86
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:31,203
these current realities that no matter how
impacted the government is and no matter

87
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:38,578
how undesirable the edifice of power on
the part of an individual, be elected

88
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:43,082
or be appointed, anarchy is still worse.

89
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:51,290
And therefore, we, I mean Yahadus, sanction
the idea of the political community.

90
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:57,530
The idea of a state, very reluctantly.

91
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,138
If I were

92
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:12,144
to characterize the attitude
of Yahadus to our political

93
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,248
community, I would categorize it

94
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:26,626
under the class of those precepts
of which our Rabbis, Chazal,

95
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:32,999
said, "Lo dibrah Torah
keneged yetzer ha'ra." Basically,

96
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:38,037
the institutions are imperfect, but imperfect man

97
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,606
must have imperfect institutions.

98
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:45,645
You cannot create a perfect
institution for imperfect man.

99
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,384
And you know very well,
you all probably say pereks

100
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,152
summer -- during the summer time.

101
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,424
I would even make a recommendation
this perek be studied in the yeshiva.

102
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:06,132
Now, students may riot and go on
strikes in order to enforce this.

103
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,504
Basically, Rabbi Chanina Sgan

104
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:18,444
HaKohanim meant to convey the same
thought when he made his famous

105
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:24,350
statement, "Hevei mispallel bishlomah
shel malchus," pray for the welfare

106
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,522
of government, "ish es rei'eihu chaim.”

107
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:36,562
They just have to think, is that while

108
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,099
government is never perfect,

109
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:50,443
but we -- we must have order
and -- a power structure because

110
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,213
without it, evil would triumph.

111
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:05,891
Let us just give our attention to the
precept of minuy melech because if we

112
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:12,098
want halachically to find out about the
attitude of Yahadus throughout government

113
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:18,037
in general and monarch in particular,
we must investigate halachically.

114
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,608
I mean, the mitzvah -- the precept of
minuy melech, the appointment of a king.

115
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,848
And by analyzing this precept, we'll arrive
at certain conclusions, which will be

116
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,751
very relevant to our subject matter.

117
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:38,357
The commandment concerning
the appointment of a king is not

118
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,659
without certain reservations.

119
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:50,636
I once heard from my father,
zichrono livrachah, that the

120
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:57,243
validity of the commandment is
dependent upon the fulfillment of

121
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,813
two prerequisites, of two conditions.

122
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:15,194
First, we are commanded or
duty-bound to appoint a king

123
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:21,200
if there is need for him.

124
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:27,807
If history, actually, dictates to us

125
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:38,951
and the -- this appointment and
requires the setting up of monarchy.

126
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,857
If, for instance,

127
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:49,094
that they felt the king is
indispensable for the defense

128
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,865
of the people and of their land,

129
00:13:54,166 --> 00:14:04,043
then it's incumbent upon us to set up a
monarchy and appoint a king who should

130
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:09,615
fight our battles, who should defend
the land and defend the physical and

131
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,618
spiritual survival of the Jewish people.

132
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:19,458
The very Braisa -- the famous
Braisa in Sanhedrin that

133
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:25,431
has identified the verse of "Som tasim
alecha melech," thou shall appoint a

134
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:30,502
king as a positive precept, as binding,

135
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,542
speaks to other precepts, which

136
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,614
are tightly connected with that of the
appointment of a king, tasim li melech.

137
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:49,521
Namely, whoever knows it, the -- to defeat
Amalek, the destruction of Amalek and

138
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:58,230
the construction of the Beis Hamikdash,
which has to follow the appointment.

139
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,936
In other words, the duty of the
king is to provide the land and

140
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,473
the people this maximum security.

141
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,378
Otherwise, there would be no need
for the setting up of a monarchy.

142
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:23,455
Another situation may motivate or
prompt the selection of a king,

143
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:30,062
of a ruler, namely anarchy and
the breakdown of law and order.

144
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:38,337
The Bible in Shoftim, it means the
book preceding Samuel in which the

145
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,307
appointment of the king -- I mean, came up,

146
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:47,279
tells us and emphasizes
and reemphasizes, "Ba'yamim ha'hem," in

147
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:53,118
those days, "ein melech b'Yisrael," there
was no king in Israel, "ish

148
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,389
ha'yashar b'einav yaaseh," whatever a
person likes to do, he was free to do.

149
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,293
Why does the pasuk
emphasize it many times?

150
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:08,267
Because exactly this is -- this was
the determining factor which made the

151
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,602
appointment of the king mandatory.

152
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:18,077
If law and order had prevailed, I mean,
without a king, there would be no need for it.

153
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,919
The Rambam states in Hilchos Melachim -- Perek Dalet in Hilchos Melachim, Halachah 5,

154
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:35,227
"Sh'ein mamlichin melech
techilah ela laasos mishpat v'nilchem

155
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:42,901
milchamos. Sh'ne'emar 'U'shfatanu
malkeinu v'yatza lefaneinu v'nilcham

156
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:49,575
es milchamoseinu.'" The prime reason
for appointing a king was that he

157
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:57,449
implement the principles of justice
and wage war, as it is written, "And

158
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:03,522
that our king may judge us and go
out before us and fight our battles."

159
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,290
In a word,

160
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:14,266
the power structure is justified
if there is an external goal,

161
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:21,507
a transeunt goal which required
the setting up of such a structure.

162
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,944
Only the attainment of the goal

163
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,249
justifies the means.

164
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,858
There is purpose in this for
malchus, and the purpose not

165
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,294
in the power structure itself.

166
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,296
It's outside the power structure.

167
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,864
It is transeunt.

168
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,969
There is a teleology of kings, of royalty.

169
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:55,407
Each king has his own
to'eles, his own goal.

170
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:04,249
Each king pursues his own objective,
and the pursuit of the objective and

171
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:09,188
the effort on the part of the king to
realize the goal justifies kingdom,

172
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:14,993
human kingdom, which is always imperfect.

173
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:27,806
Each meluchah for each melech is charged
with a specific task according to Yahadus.

174
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,678
You don't appoint a melech just for
the sake of dominion or for the sake

175
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,181
of rule, of ruling or for the sake of

176
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:41,787
exercizing power or wielding authority.

177
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:48,293
Each melech, each king was
charged with a specific task.

178
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:57,803
Each one pursued a definitive objective,
whose implementation was the prime reason

179
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:03,442
for the ascendency of the king to malchut.

180
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:11,049
For instance, David's kingdom, the
kingdom of the great King David,

181
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:17,589
was wholly committed -- wholly
committed to the unification of the

182
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:25,464
loosely separated Tribes and the
complete conquest of Eretz Yisrael.

183
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,199
It's a timely subject.

184
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,237
And the security of the people.

185
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,476
If you study Shmuel well, you'll
find it between the lines.

186
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,978
And what does it tell
us, the malchus David?

187
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:46,485
It tells us of achdut Yisrael, kivush
ha'aretz and, of course, the safety

188
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,387
and the security of the people.

189
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:54,426
Solomon's rule was concerned
with the binyan Beis Hamikdash,

190
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:59,998
with the establishment of
the spiritual, sacred center,

191
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,869
the construction of the sanctuary.

192
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,872
Chizkiyah's rule, according to

193
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,841
our oral tradition, according to
Torah Sh'Baal Peh, 

194
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,646
was dedicated

195
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,749
to the perpetuation of Torah.

196
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,186
According to Pirkei D’rabbi Nasan, 

197
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,723
the founder of the Anshei Knesses HaGedolah

198
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,359
was not anyone but Chizkiyahu.

199
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:44,843
It means, in other words,
malchut is justified if there

200
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,946
is an assignment for malchut.

201
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,817
If there is no assignment,
there is no need for malchut.

202
00:20:55,153 --> 00:21:01,059
The second prerequisite is

203
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,765
that the people request the
appointment of the king.

204
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:20,379
That the people recognize the need, that
the people state the need and ask Beis

205
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,882
Din or the prophet to appoint a king.

206
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:33,325
No monarch should be imposed upon the
people no matter how great the need it is.

207
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,429
In Devarim,

208
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,831
when the Torah

209
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,470
stated the precept of malchus,

210
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:51,610
it has qualified, that the
precept of malchut is linked up

211
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,713
with the request made by the people.

212
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,015
"V'amarta

213
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:03,021
asimu alai melech k'chol ha'goyim
asher sevivosai," and you make

214
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:07,693
the request or you make the demand
for the appointment of a king.

215
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,663
"Sim tasim alecha melech,"
then -- and of course,

216
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:18,170
people recognize the need, a great
assignment awaits the king, 

217
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:24,810
but the people want him, then "Sim tasim
alecha melech," then Beis Din

218
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,247
is duty-bound to comply with
the request and appoint a king.

219
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:36,021
If the people do not utter
such a wish, Beis Din has no

220
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,757
right to establish a monarchy.

221
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,027
That the

222
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,001
suggestion of appointing a king
must come from the people and only then,

223
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:56,174
in compliance with their will, Beis Din
is obligated to select a monarch, is

224
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:01,246
stated almost unequivocally by the Rambam.

225
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,284
The Rambam's referring to a ma’amar of Rabbi Nehorai in Sanhedrin, which I

226
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,588
cannot analyze now, says as follows.

227
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:16,395
"Mei'achar sh'hakamas melech mitzvah
lamah li ratzah Hakadosh Baruch Hu

228
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:24,536
k'sh'shaalu melech mi'Shmuel lefi
sh'shaalu b'taromes v'lo shaalu

229
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:29,708
lekayem ha'mitzvah ela mipnei sh'katzu
bi'Shmuel HaNavi sh'ne'emar 'Lo is'cha

230
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,512
maasu ki osi.'" I'll translate it.

231
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:39,384
Seeing that the setting up the king
was a commandment, why did the Holy

232
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:46,958
One look with disfavor upon the request
made by the people of Samuel for a king?

233
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:55,634
Because they asked in a grievous spirit,
the request was prompted not by a desire

234
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:03,375
to fulfill a precept but by a desire to
rid themselves of Samuel the Prophet,

235
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:09,614
as it is written, "For they have not
rejected thee, but they have rejected Me."

236
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,252
I believe

237
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,956
that the question

238
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,027
must be asked immediately.

239
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:26,898
The question arises immediately,
and it's an obvious question.

240
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:35,140
Why should the way in which the
request was made affect the validity

241
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:41,346
or the binding character of the
precept of appointing the king?

242
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:47,486
Let us assume the request was not phrased in proper and intelligent language. 

243
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,021
And that

244
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,125
the motive was it -- the wrong one.

245
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,163
There was still no reason for Shmuel

246
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,868
or Hakadosh Baruch Hu, kaviyachol,
to look with disfavor upon

247
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,870
the appointment of a king,

248
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:13,545
which constitutes a basic
precept, a mitzvah min haTorah.

249
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:23,722
What -- the wrong motivation
never nullifies the worth of the

250
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:30,295
act of a mitzvah deed, a gross
approach might not render

251
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:35,066
a deserving, noble act null and void.

252
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,772
You know, all remember the Rav -- the
Rav saying, "L'olam yaasok adam

253
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:46,111
b'Torah u'b'mitzvos sh'lo
lishmah u'mitoch sh'lo lishmah ba lishma”

254
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,948
And why did Hakadosh Baruch classify

255
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:57,455
their petition for a
king wrong and sinful, equating

256
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:03,495
-- equating it with rebellion
against G-d's authority, 

257
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,933
"Lo os'cha maasu ki im osi."

258
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:15,707
Of course, the only logical conclusion
could be derived from Maimonides,

259
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,009
from this quotation from the Rambam.

260
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:26,051
That the request for a king is
of central significance since it is

261
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,920
the source of [inaudible].

262
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:36,194
Since it legitimizes the power
structure created by the appointment.

263
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,529
Since

264
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,433
the request is a condition, a sine qua non 

265
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,704
for the fulfillment of the

266
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:50,408
implementation and the mitzvah of
minuy melech, of appointing a king.

267
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:55,013
Therefore, it is necessary that the

268
00:26:55,013 --> 00:27:01,052
request be formulated in
compliance with the halachah.

269
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,559
That means the request is not
phrased in the proper and which -- and

270
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:13,131
is motivated by a wrong desire;
it fails to produce results.

271
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:18,737
And the appointment of a king is not mandatory.

272
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,506
And whenever

273
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,010
the appointment of a king is
not obligatory or mandatory,

274
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,414
it is sinful to appoint a king.

275
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,117
"Lo os'cha maasu ki osi."

276
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:43,495
The reason for the reluctance on the part
of Yahadus, to set up permanent power

277
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,365
structures -- because a monarch is a
permanent power structure -- such as

278
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:51,002
monarchy, is due to two motives.

279
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,973
First,

280
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,351
as the old saying goes, 

281
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,887
power corrupts.

282
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,892
Abuse of power is inevitable.

283
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:21,399
The greatest of all rulers, of all
kings, the most ideal charismatic

284
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:29,774
leader is bound, willy-nilly, to step over
the boundary of legitimate authority

285
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:38,083
and engage in some kind of tyranny,
arbitrary decisions, unfair practices.

286
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:47,392
Power -- this is with the view of Yahadus
-- contrary to the popular opinion,

287
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:52,464
limits the freedom of the man of power.

288
00:28:55,867 --> 00:29:02,874
The loss of freedom on the part of
the man of power is proportionate

289
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,311
to the amount of power with

290
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,681
which he was endowed and equipped.

291
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,986
The more authority that people bestow upon him,

292
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,557
the more of his
freedom is taken away.

293
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:30,568
The more the number of options which
he has at his disposal is limited.

294
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,945
Just now to quote one pasuk,
when Saul came back -- we just

295
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,413
read it last -- not last Shabbos,

296
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,617
but -- uh, the Shabbos Zachor.

297
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:53,658
When Saul came back from Amalek, bringing
along Agog and some cattle and some sheep.

298
00:29:54,826 --> 00:30:01,032
And then Shmuel asked him why he violated
the word of G-d, why he didn't comply

299
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,768
with the instructions he gave him.

300
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:10,441
So Shaul had one excuse and this excuse

301
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,577
was very -- was fatal.

302
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,649
This excuse, I'm afraid,
sealed Shaul's destiny.

303
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:24,322
"Vayachmol Shaul v'ha'am al Agag v'al meitav ha'tzon."

304
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:33,364
Saul tries to justify his action
vis-á-vis Amalek when Samuel rebuked him,

305
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,301
for the people took of the spoil.

306
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,771
I didn't take; the
people took of the spoil.

307
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,409
And the word vayachmol
ha'am should be underlined.

308
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,644
I didn't take.

309
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,346
The people took of

310
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,482
the spoil, of the sheep, of the oxen.

311
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,117
I could not stop them.

312
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:58,089
I had to listen, too, and
reckon with the crowd.

313
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:01,526
A king cannot get along without a crowd.

314
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:11,336
The ruler must read the mind of
the gullible and very excitable crowd,

315
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:17,942
And when the ruler must
be concerned with the crowd

316
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:24,949
he cannot exercise -- he cannot exercise
legitimate authority or legitimate power.

317
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:30,455
But this reason is basically
of secondary nature.

318
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,493
This is not the main reason why
Yahadus was so reluctant and so

319
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:40,698
unwilling to accept power structures.

320
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:47,538
[missing audio]

321
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,047
Certainly, Yahadus says

322
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,448
the ruler is capable.

323
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,651
Otherwise, he wouldn't be a ruler.

324
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:06,190
Brilliant, G-d
blessed him with a sense of leadership

325
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,194
and an inspiring personality.

326
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,502
Certainly, those are -- who are

327
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:24,709
subordinated to him are down,
meek and in need of guidance.

328
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,187
So it's quite natural that one rules
and the other one is being ruled,

329
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:45,229
but Yahadus asks, but does
intellectual superiority

330
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,268
justify the exercise of power?

331
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:59,043
Do personal traits, no matter how
relevant, grant a person the right to

332
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,480
order, to instruct and to dominate?

333
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,387
And in general, Yahadus never
measured the worth of the human

334
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:16,761
personality by the yardstick of
his traits, his talents, never.

335
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:29,040
Yahadus many times, has repeated -- repeated
many times, a contrite heart is more

336
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,879
cherished by the Almighty than a keen
mind and a person modest and humble.

337
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:46,657
Because circumstances prevented him from
actualizing the human potential which G-d

338
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:52,163
implanted in him is more acceptable to
the Almighty than a person being proud

339
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:57,568
because he was lucky and circumstances
favored him and gave him the opportunity

340
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:05,810
to achieve fame and take advantage of
every talent G-d has equipped him with.

341
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:15,686
Moreover, man is not being invited
to share the attribute of meluchah

342
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:19,791
and memshalah, we say,
"Ha'meluchah v'ha'memshalah

343
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:28,199
l'chai olamim," kingdom and might
belongs exclusively to the eternal.

344
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:35,206
True, many divine potencies

345
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,475
are accessible to man.

346
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:47,185
The Almighty asks of man quite often
to join him and, paradoxically, to

347
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,022
be like Him, "V'halachta bi'drachav."

348
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:59,931
Moreover, it is G-d's will that man
imitate him, that man follow in his

349
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:06,270
ways, that man attempt to be divine,

350
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:15,746
to participate in the infinite moral
acting on the part of the Almighty.

351
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:24,922
"V'halachata bi'drachav," more pungent
is the expression "V'anveihu," Ani V’Hu

352
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:30,728
I like Him, "mah hu chanun,"
He is merciful, I want to be

353
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,098
merciful as well, "mah hu rachum,"

354
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,835
He's charitable and kind, I
want to be charitable and kind

355
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,938
as well, and so forth, so on.

356
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:50,148
Yet, power is an exception to the rule
of "V'halachta bi'drachav." You don't say

357
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,285
He is mighty; I also want to be mighty.

358
00:35:55,386 --> 00:36:01,559
Power is an exclusive divine
potency to which man has no access.

359
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,296
Melech Elyon

360
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,967
dislikes very much -- Melech Evyon.

361
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,539
If the latter begins to
take himself seriously.

362
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:26,017
The quest for power, basically,
precipitated the first

363
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,220
scene on the part of man.

364
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:36,727
The serpent took advantage of human -- of
the human urge to rule, to dominate,

365
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:42,200
to be mighty, to emerge victorious from
every engagement, to legislate his own

366
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,538
laws, et cetera, and persuaded Eve to sin

367
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,412
by telling her that through eating
from the Tree of Knowledge,

368
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,548
she will realize her ambition.

369
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,684
She'll become powerful.

370
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:04,088
"Vi'heyisem kei'Elokim yodei tov va'ra."

371
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:16,334
And Yahadus was not only wary and
cautious with regard to the political

372
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:21,072
community, the so-called executive
branch of power and the legislative

373
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:26,544
branch of power, but also very
cautious with reference to the judicial

374
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,747
community, for the judicial branch of

375
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,283
government.

376
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:40,157
And again, Yahadus has always
been confronted with an antinomy,

377
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:46,397
inquiring into the very core of
power exercise and power structure,

378
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,367
including the judicial power structure.

379
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:56,807
On one hand, Yahadus was convinced that
due to the -- to the human situation

380
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:02,880
or to a human situation, when one
cannot dispense with those structures.

381
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,018
On the other hand, it

382
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:12,823
is consistently argued that
man is not entitled to sit in

383
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,259
judgment over his fellow man.

384
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:20,931
Only G-d has the right to judge
people, "Elokim nitzav ba'adas

385
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:26,470
Kel b'kerev Elokim yishpot."
That's why Yahadus is complicated.

386
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:34,412
It's very much -- sometimes we -- we marvel at the difficulties and

387
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:42,320
complexities -- complexities that Yahadus
has introduced in the judicial process.

388
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:52,029
It has almost eliminated not only bodily
punishment, 

389
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,498
we have many chayevey misa, yes.

390
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,504
But we have
executed very few in our history.

391
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:09,613
We have many chayvu malkus, but we
have implemented this punish -- this

392
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,884
penalty very rarely -- very rarely.

393
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,189
It has eliminated not only
bodily punishment but also

394
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,891
monetary fines like k'nas.

395
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:26,931
Nowadays, you know, "ein anu danim
dinei k'nasos," because we lack

396
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,533
semichah, we -- we lack the authority.

397
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:37,241
Even as regards trivial, everyday
litigation, in civil matters, 

398
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:46,083
Yahadus has almost, with fear and foreboding,
warned the dayan, the justice who is

399
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:54,291
authorized to resolve the controversy
that he's engaged in something awesome

400
00:39:54,291 --> 00:40:03,300
and dreadful and that in case he should
err, or even faulter, in the execution

401
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,805
of justice, his sin will be unpardonable.

402
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:15,246
"L'olam yireh dayan atzmo k'ilu cherev
munachas lo al tzavaro v'Gehinnom

403
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,550
pesuchah lo mitach'tav v'yeida es mi hu dan,

404
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,522
v'lifnei mi hu dan" -- I'm reading
Maimon -- the Rambam -- "u'mi asid

405
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:30,361
l'hipara mimenu im nata mi'kav ha'emes
sh'ne'emar 'Elokim nitzav baadas Kel,'

406
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:36,500
v'omer 'Re'u mah atem osim ki lo l'adam
tishpetu ki la'Adoshem.'" At all times,

407
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,473
the judge should think of himself as
if a sword were suspended over his

408
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:47,144
head and Gehinnom gaping under him.

409
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:53,517
He should know who he is judging -- whom
he's judging and before whom he's judging.

410
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:58,255
And who will
call him to account if he deviates.

411
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:04,128
Comes the line of truth, as it is written,
"G-d standed [sic] in the congregation

412
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:09,166
of G-d, in the midst of the judges."
And it's also written, "Consider what

413
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:15,306
you do, for you are judged not for
man, but for the law," Chronicles 19:6.

414
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,915
This is more or less the
general attitude of Yahadus.

415
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:30,754
Of course, I could quote many sources
substantiating and confirming,

416
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,690
I mean, my interpretation,

417
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,059
but there's no need for it.

418
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:47,972
But malchus signifies not only a
complete power structure, a political

419
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:57,481
institution or a political community,
a kingdom, government, state, but

420
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:03,087
also a great metaphysical idea.

421
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:14,064
Malchus, in its metaphysical context,
turns into a glorious vision which

422
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:20,604
the covenantal community has beheld
and has been fascinated with since

423
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,173
the dawn of its millennial history.

424
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:31,549
Malchus as a metaphysical idea, turns into
a great ethical norm, which is how

425
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,685
to achieve the ultimate objective in Yahadus.

426
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,895
Within the metaphysical frame of reference,

427
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:53,203
malchus is not a prerogative of an individual, of a single person,

428
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,741
 or a clan or a dynasty.

429
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,811
Within the metaphysical frame of reference, 

430
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,181
malchus has been bestowed upon men in general.

431
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:12,189
On that mysterious Friday, when God
fashioned him out of dust and made him

432
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:20,064
an individual being, unique and singular,
who cannot be replaced, for whom there

433
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,232
is no substitute.

434
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:29,907
Later man lost malchus, according
to Chazal, when he sinned.

435
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:36,080
And God wants His covenantal
community, His people, to restore the

436
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,116
quality of malchus to its members.

437
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:48,692
So basically, the potential of malchus
has been implanted in every Jew.

438
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,431
The question is how to implement
it, how to realize it.

439
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:58,469
Of course, in order to realize it, we
have got to understand what it is, what

440
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,805
it stands for, what it requires of man.

441
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:15,452
How does malchus, as a moral
metaphysical idea, express itself?

442
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,154
How does it express itself?

443
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,425
Again, we must consult the Halachah.

444
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:28,766
We stated, and we also tried
to prove, that malchus as a

445
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,201
legitimate political structure

446
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:42,079
requires an objective,
a telos, an assignment.

447
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:47,418
Whenever there is urgent need for the
setting up of such an institution,

448
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:53,991
it's incumbent upon us to implement
the precepts of appointing a king.

449
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:58,562
In other words, malchus is significant

450
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:08,005
whenever history burdens this
institution with a specific mission.

451
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:15,746
As I said before, the power structure
is of a teleological nature.

452
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:22,753
In a word, malchus

453
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:24,988
equals

454
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,859
assignment awareness.

455
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:37,301
The awareness that one has an assignment
to implement and to carry out.

456
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:45,375
The equation is of course, like
many other equations, reversible.

457
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:52,082
We may say, therefore, an
assignment awareness equals malchus.

458
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,787
Who is king?

459
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,123
Who is king in the metaphysical sense?

460
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,927
Whoever felt -- feels committed.

461
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:10,067
Whoever feels committed to the
achievement of a great goal; 

462
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,804
to the realization of an objective.

463
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,008
Who is a king?

464
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,677
Whoever carries a load.

465
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:26,183
It's very strange that in
Hebrew, a load, masa, is

466
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:33,590
of course, to be understood in a physical
sense and also in a spiritual sense.

467
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,492
Masa is also prophecy.

468
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:40,230
The prophet is loaded, or burdened.

469
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,635
He's dedicated, he's committed.

470
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,636
He's not free.

471
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:52,810
Malchus takes away freedom, I
told you before, but not -- but

472
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:58,448
by taking away freedom, one's
personality is being enhanced.

473
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:01,819
Who is king?

474
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:05,122
Whoever is burdened with a task.

475
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:06,857
Who is king?

476
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:13,864
Whoever has a concern for
something, and he is ready, I

477
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:17,334
mean, to implement his assignment.

478
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,837
And here, I said it many times.

479
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,273
I don't know when I last
spoke to you about it.

480
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:27,311
Here Yahadus comes in with
its doctrine of assignment.

481
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,146
It's a very important doctrine.

482
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,283
Not only important theoretically or
philosophically; it's important

483
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,885
in practical terms, too.

484
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:44,795
Each man was created in order
to carry out a certain task.

485
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,632
He was created at a certain time,

486
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:54,972
in a certain place, in a certain society,
he was born into a certain family.

487
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:04,181
Because all those circumstances will
make it possible for him to implement

488
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,749
his tasks.

489
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:12,556
The fact that I wasn't born a
century ago is because a century

490
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,993
ago, I couldn't carry out my task.

491
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,996
I can't -- that's what they say,

492
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,099
Elokai, ad shelo notzarti, 

493
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,137
I wasn't created 100 years ago, 

494
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:30,974
I wasn't created 200 years ago, I
was not created 300 years ago.

495
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:38,782
I was not created during -- in the course
of countless centuries, in many millennia.

496
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,017
You know why?

497
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,153
Eineni kedai,

498
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:49,359
because I was not worthy of being
created, because I had no assignment.

499
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,296
Had I been created, I wouldn't
have had an assignment.

500
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:58,835
Each man was created in order
to carry out a certain task.

501
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:04,574
Each individual was entrusted with
a specific assignment which he must

502
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:10,347
implement, no matter how difficult,
and no matter how embarrassing

503
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,550
sometimes the implementation is.

504
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:27,998
It is not just incidental that in Hebrew,
we do not distinguish between wage

505
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:36,673
and reward, between contracted and
non-contracted compensation, the way

506
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:41,745
we do -- we do in other languages.

507
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:48,518
We say in English a wage means
that you pay a laborer or a

508
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:52,289
hireling whom you contracted to
perform a certain task for you.

509
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,159
When you say a reward, it
means a gratuitous award.

510
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,298
You give him because he is meritorious,
but there is no obligation and no

511
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,066
commitment on your part to reward him.

512
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,303
If you do reward him, it's a
voluntary act on your part.

513
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:07,504
It's generosity.

514
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,440
Yahadus has no two words.

515
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:18,749
The Biblical and Talmudic Hebrew, in
the Biblical and -- and the Talmudic

516
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:28,859
Hebrew, the noun sachar has the
connotation of reward, as well as of wage.

517
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:34,364
The noun sachar has a dual
connotation, a wage and reward.

518
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:43,707
Yahadus apparently, has apparently
considered the good bestowed upon man

519
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:51,381
for a meritorious life as an earned
wage, not as a gratuitous reward.

520
00:50:52,949 --> 00:51:01,358
Because man, according to Yahadus, is
under contractual obligation to his

521
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,194
employer, who happens to be the Almighty.

522
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:12,469
He is actually a hireling who was
contracted to perform a specific task

523
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:23,814
and who, upon completing his assignment,
may lay claim to well-earned compensation.

524
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,719
And it is not -- and there is
nothing new in what I am saying.

525
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,488
It's a verse in Iyov.

526
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,559
"Im charutzim yamav mispar

527
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:42,833
chodashav itach chukav asis -- asisa
v'lo ya'avor. She'ei mei'alav

528
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,402
v'yechdal ad yirtzeh k'sachir."

529
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:52,442
Seeing his days are determined, the number
of his months are with Thee, and Thou has

530
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,378
appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.

531
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:01,685
If you look away from him that
he may rest until he shall

532
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,421
accomplish, as a hireling, his day.

533
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:11,261
The life of man is like a day which
has been completed by the hireling.

534
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,331
Man is a sachir.

535
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:22,139
Of course, you know very well that the
assignment theory, doctrine was -- has

536
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:29,045
been spelled out in unmistakable
terms, unequivocal and unmistakable

537
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,947
terms in what book in Tanach?

538
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,283
In what book in Tanach?

539
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:38,188
The assignment doctrine, man is
created and charged with an assignment.

540
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:42,159
And all he has to do is
to carry out his task.

541
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,227
In what book?

542
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,228
What book?

543
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,267
Yonah.

544
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,169
Yes, of course.

545
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,370
Yonah, yes.

546
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:57,440
But Yonah you speak of a prophet, nevu'ah.

547
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,808
Of course, nevu'ah is also an assignment.

548
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,344
It's a load placed upon the prophecy.

549
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,612
It's a burden.

550
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,282
But I believe there’s another
book, we just read it.

551
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,918
In the Megillah.

552
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,356
In the Megillah.

553
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,493
Isn’t it?

554
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:22,032
And I believe that the assignment doctrine
is a focal theme of the Megillah.

555
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,641
Let me read a pasuk, it's one pasuk.

556
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:38,348
"Al tedami v'nafsheich l'himaleit
beis hamelech mikol hayehudim.

557
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:44,621
im hachareish tacharishi ba'eis hazos
revach v'hatzalah ya'amod layehudim

558
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:52,495
mimakom acher v'as u'veis avich toveidu,
u'mi yodei'a," I'm emphasizing the words,

559
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,798
"im l'eis kazos higa'at lamalchus."

560
00:53:55,165 --> 00:54:02,272
Nu, would someone volunteer
to translate these words?

561
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,211
Think not with thyself that
thou shall escape in the king's

562
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,547
house more than all the Jews.

563
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:19,022
If thou altogether holdeth thy peace
at this time, then the relief and

564
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:23,593
deliverance will arise to the Jews
from another place, but thou and thy

565
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:30,533
fathers' house will perish, and who
knows whether thou art not come to

566
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,003
royal estate for such a time as this?

567
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:42,846
Basically, what Mordechai said is simply
that there is an assignment for each individual.

568
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,950
And he reminded Esther of
the assignment which was entrusted to her

569
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:54,824
and of the summons -- of the historical
summons which she has to answer.

570
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,462
And about -- and of the
historical challenge which

571
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,299
she has to accept and to meet.

572
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:09,639
Basically, Mordechai analyzed
here and formulated three ideas

573
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,275
within the assignment doctrine.

574
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:17,180
The assignment doctrine consists
of three basic thoughts.

575
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,216
First, each

576
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:25,021
individual is assigned a task which he

577
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,090
must implement.

578
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:33,897
The assignment never
transcends one's ability.

579
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:41,137
The individual is never required
of -- to do something that is

580
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,139
above and beyond his reach.

581
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:51,581
And as far as Esther is concerned,
Mordechai said, Esther was favored by

582
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:59,356
the Almighty with beauty and irresistible
charm and at the same time, charged

583
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,825
with the mission of saving her people.

584
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:03,827
It is strange.

585
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:09,933
The mission of saving the people
who was placed squarely upon

586
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:17,107
the athletic, strong shoulders of David
and his commander-in chief Yoav, and now,

587
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:25,181
the same mission, was placed upon
the frail, upon the frail shoulders

588
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:32,589
of a delicate and lonely woman who's
-- who's -- who continuously lived in

589
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,591
the shadow of rejection and death.

590
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:43,800
She was burdened with the same mission
with which the kingdom of David

591
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,102
was charged, to save the people

592
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:54,811
and to defeat a formidable
enemy and to protect the Jewish

593
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,179
community from annihilation.

594
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:03,453
And if you will ask me now, what
is our assignment in these days?

595
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,791
What is the assignment of
the Jewish community in 1969?

596
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,826
Of course, it’s very hard to guess.

597
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:15,532
Each one has an assignment which is
known only to God Almighty, but sometimes

598
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:24,274
we may -- we may find out, we may
explore -- just, I mean, a bit and, and,

599
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,142
and somehow come across the assignment.

600
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,779
What is the assignment that -- with
which we are charged now,

601
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,449
everyone, every Jew, man or woman?

602
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,819
I believe the assignment is a double one.

603
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:44,327
First, to safeguard and protect
the physical -- the Jew physically.

604
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,297
To defend the physical
survival of the Jew.

605
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:53,636
First of all, in Eretz Yisrael it is
a daily problem because it's not a

606
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,173
question in Eretz Yisrael about a state.

607
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,676
This is already a minor problem.

608
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,480
This is already a secondary
or a thirdly problem.

609
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,751
The Arabs don't want to annihilate
the state -- only the state.

610
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:15,058
They simply want to annihilate the
Jewish community as such, because

611
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:21,498
we live in a post-Hitlerian -- in a
post-Hitlerian era, and the Jewish

612
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,800
enemy is very sophisticated now.

613
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,372
In the Middle Ages and in modern times,
the enemy of the Jew tried to -- tried

614
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:36,546
to persecute the Jew, to legislate
restrictive laws, to make his life

615
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:42,752
hard, to lock him up in the ghetto, to
take away his franchise, his liberties.

616
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,255
But now these enemies of the Jews are sophisticated.

617
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,623
He's a liberal.

618
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,492
He's a democrat now.

619
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,862
All he wants is to kill the Jew.

620
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,766
And what do you think?

621
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,102
If the Arabs had
won -- rachmana litzlan, if the

622
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,371
Arabs had won the war in 1967,

623
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,408
what would have happened
to the Jewish population?

624
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:11,381
It is entrusted not only to the
Israelis, but us as well.

625
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,919
And I don't mean as far as extending
help to Israel is concerned, but

626
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:20,423
I mean even in the diaspora we
should be on alert -- on alert.

627
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:25,361
Look out for any manifestation of
anti-Semitism, for any leaflet,

628
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:28,665
for any song, for any poem on the radio.

629
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,578
And let not liberals or intellectuals tell
you it is irrelevant, it is kid stuff.

630
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:47,417
I lived in Germany during the
ascendancy of Hitler to power, 

631
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,587
and I heard the same song in Germany.

632
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:54,724
When the Hitler brigade used to
march through Kurfürstendamm and

633
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:59,395
sing the, the Horst Wessel song,
so the intellectuals laughed.

634
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,531
They joked.

635
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:08,605
But apparently, kid stuff has
resulted in the crematoria at Majdanek

636
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,406
and the gas chambers of Majdanek.

637
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,808
Look out for it!

638
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:17,280
And no politician, mayor or
governor or, or, or congressman or

639
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:23,686
senator should be tolerated if he
tolerates anti-Semitic literature

640
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:29,225
or statements of city
employees or city appointees.

641
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:43,573
Secondly, this is the assignment
which resembles the tasks with

642
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,342
which Mordechai challenged Esther.

643
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:47,577
Second.

644
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,914
This is just as important
as the first assignment.

645
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:59,088
We must defend the spiritual
identity of the Jew in the diaspora,

646
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,124
and as well as in Eretz Yisrael.

647
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:06,462
Against assimilationism,
against disintegration, and also

648
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,332
against apostasy, against shmad.

649
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,267
Don't dismiss this problem.

650
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:24,313
Now this is the first -- the first
element of the doctrine of, 

651
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:30,987
assignment which Mordechai formulated,
is simply that each individual is

652
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:36,592
entrusted with a task and he -- which
he must implement at all costs.

653
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:42,098
Second -- what is, what
is the second part?

654
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:47,837
The second element of the doctrine
of assignment the way Mordechai

655
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:51,307
has defined and formulated it,

656
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:56,879
in case of human failure and human

657
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:05,455
betrayals and human indifference,
God's will will be done anyway.

658
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:15,064
The assignment will be carried
out, if not by the -- by the

659
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,166
individual, by someone else.

660
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,373
"Im hachareish tacharishi ba'eis
hazos revach v'hatzalah ya'amod

661
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,109
layehudim mimakom acher."

662
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:32,548
And third, the third element, the
individual who did not answer the

663
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:38,454
call of history and did not respond
to the challenge and did not carry

664
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:43,159
out his assignment is a traitor and

665
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,795
his sin is unpardonable.

666
01:02:52,935 --> 01:03:01,277
Now, malchut, in order to be a melech,
to acquire not a kingdom – there is no

667
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:05,314
need to acquire a kingdom – but kingship.

668
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,316
To acquire not a meluchah, but malchut.

669
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,652
One must be aware

670
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,722
of the assignment.

671
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,625
That man is a committed
being, not a free being.

672
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:19,328
But malchus contains another dimension.

673
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:25,434
Namely that of an open existence.

674
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,069
I want to -- I want to explain.

675
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:33,976
Let me explain -- explain it
by introducing a Kabbalistic equation.

676
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:47,256
To the ubiquitous
presence of God within the world.

677
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,292
Not outside, but in this world.

678
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,362
Within the natural cosmic order or drama.

679
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,365
When we mention or we say

680
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,467
or pronounce the name of the Holy One – 

681
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,269
Kel.

682
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:10,379
We refer to His remoteness, transcendence
beyond the fringes and the outskirts of

683
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:11,914
the universe.

684
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,418
And above the here-and-now reality.

685
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,923
However, when we say Shechina,

686
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:27,530
we address ourselves to God who
has never been distant from us,

687
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:31,133
who stands next to us, or to me,

688
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:35,338
who trails behind me and
walks in front of me.

689
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,107
Adoshem tzili al yad yemini.

690
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:46,182
To God with whom I converse, to
whom I pray and cling in times of

691
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:52,221
distress, to whom I sing a hymn of
praise when destiny is good to me.

692
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:56,125
 In whom I confined -- I confide, 

693
01:04:56,125 --> 01:05:03,165
and  in whom I find comfort and solace 
and peace of mind and serenity. 

694
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:11,007
 In short, Shechinah denotes an open, 
communicative, divine presence 

695
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:19,348
 in nearness which stands against 
separating creator from creature.

696
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:27,056
 You know very well that Shechinah 
is from the verb shachein. 

697
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,591
 And what does shachein mean? 

698
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:33,129
 To abide, to be present, to reside. 

699
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,365
 You know what shachein in Hebrew means? 

700
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,633
A neighbor.

701
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,337
However,

702
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:48,577
the term Shechinah signifies not only
imminence and proximity in a communicative

703
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:54,283
sense, but also in a sympathetic sense.

704
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,486
Shechinah is the mother,

705
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:08,230
matronita, who is kind and understanding
and displays unlimited tolerance and

706
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,833
patience for her imperfect child.

707
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:17,940
And that imperfect child happens to be
man himself, in all his majesty and glory.

708
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:25,781
Forgiving his shortcomings, overlooking
his errors, and not minding his

709
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,451
nonsensical insolence and impudence.

710
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:34,790
Patiently, she waits for her
child to come back, to regret, to

711
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:38,561
confess, and to amend his ways.

712
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,664
She never deserts her child.

713
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,934
She never deserts a sinner.

714
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:51,140
Ani Adoshem hashochein
itam b'toch tum'osam.

715
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:58,080
I am God who resides in the
midst of their defiled existence.

716
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:05,955
In a word, Shechinah

717
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:09,925
is not -- Shechinah not
only communicates to man,

718
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:16,499
but also has compassion for man.

719
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:23,339
She shares his troubles, his cares,
his tragic experiences and failures

720
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:27,476
for which -- for which he
himself is responsible.

721
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:33,616
B'zman she'adam mitz'ta'er, the
Mishnah says in Sanhedrin, Shechinah

722
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:37,520
mah omeres, what does Shechinah

723
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,057
say, kalani mizero'i, kalani meiroshi.

724
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:45,594
I have pain in my arm,
I have pain in my head.

725
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:55,504
The same is true -- applies to the
individuals who want to achieve kingship.

726
01:07:55,771 --> 01:08:00,142
because al pi kabbalah, according to
kabbalah, Shechinah equals malchus

727
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,311
– Shechinah is identical with malchus.

728
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,649
So what is malchus?

729
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,484
What is kingship?

730
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,587
How does one achieve
kingship, how does one

731
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,722
realize the idea of kingship?

732
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,425
By

733
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,362
having an open existence.

734
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:24,166
An open existence is a royal existence.

735
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:28,938
The king resides in the
midst of the people.

736
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,973
It's quite interesting

737
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:39,915
that a king in Israel was always close
to his subjects, accessible to them.

738
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,019
Read the Tanach, leader of

739
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,956
a wood chopper, water drawer,

740
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:55,664
vagabond, stranger, and old-timer,
senior and babe, thief and merchant,

741
01:08:55,664 --> 01:09:02,838
everybody and everyone could
approach the king to complain for him

742
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,710
and to demand justice and to ask for help.

743
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,479
I'll just quote the pesukim.

744
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:16,085
Then came there -- it means
before the King Solomon -- two

745
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,454
women that were harlots,

746
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,926
unto the king and stood before him.

747
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,328
Who admitted them?

748
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,365
What is the answer?

749
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,834
There was no need for anybody
to admit them; they just

750
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,169
opened the door and walked in.

751
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:41,644
And as the king of Israel was passing
by upon the wall, there cried a woman

752
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,780
unto him saying help, my lord, my king.

753
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:51,654
Such absurd rules as -- about
which we read in the Megillah last

754
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,689
week, "ki chol ish v'ishah 

755
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,661
asher yavo… el hechatzer hapnimis

756
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:05,668
asher lo yikarei achas daso l'hamis
levad mei'asher yoshit lo hamelech

757
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,770
es sharvit hazahav v'chayah."

758
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:12,708
That appearing before the king in
the inner courtyard without the

759
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:16,679
invitation of the king, there is only
one outcome, that he is put to death.

760
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:20,983
Such absurd rules have never existed
in the annals of Yahadut.

761
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:26,055
Everybody could knock on the door
of the king and come in, because

762
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,491
everybody can knock on the door of
the king, melech malchei hamelachim

763
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:30,559
and come in.

764
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:36,932
And in the accessibility of
the melech malchei hamelachim

765
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,335
lies the mystery of tefillah.

766
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:40,936
What is tefillah?

767
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:44,406
I can open the door and walk in
and appear -- and appear before the

768
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:49,545
throne of the Almighty and complain
and to cry and to thank, 

769
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,681
 and to demand and to request and to beg. 

770
01:10:56,118 --> 01:11:04,493
In a word, man who aspires
to kingship must open up

771
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:12,468
his existence, be communicative,
accessible, and be capable of coordinating

772
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,338
his basic needs with the needs of others.

773
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,475
When I say

774
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:23,912
an open existence, please
don't make any mistake.

775
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:28,684
I do not mean the cultivation of
sociability or gregariousness.

776
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:37,726
An open existence can be achieved
by the introvert or even the

777
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:40,129
introspective person nowadays.

778
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:48,370
Sociability, gregariousness are
not necessarily the traits

779
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,940
of an -- of existential openness.

780
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:53,842
What I

781
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:59,515
want to express with
this term is that man,

782
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:11,360
while living, working, suffering,
rejoicing, and moving along an endless

783
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:18,367
trail of his own which no one else
will ever cross, must always remember

784
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:26,108
that in spite of the fact that he
is a singular being, he is not the

785
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:29,912
only one and he's not a single being.

786
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:37,953
That God's concern encompasses
not only him, but countless

787
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:45,361
individuals like him who also
wander, each one along his own trail.

788
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:53,302
 While malchus in general historical terms

789
01:12:56,438 --> 01:13:01,043
precipitates separation of the king from the people, 

790
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:07,483
 his elevation over them and his existential exquisiteness, 

791
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:12,688
 by moving the king from the periphery, 

792
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:16,458
 from the crowd, to the center,  

793
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:20,629
 malchus in Yahadus according to our view 

794
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:25,467
means integration 
of the individual in the community 

795
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:30,839
 and existential all-inclusiveness and openness.

796
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,710
 And let me tell you something. 

797
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:40,883
 It is not just pseudo-philosophy, what I tell you now. 

798
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,185
 It's more than that. 

799
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,553
 It’s of practical relevance. 

800
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,890
 Malchus within Yahadus means 

801
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,793
the acceptance of the Klal Yisrael.  

802
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:53,228
Good or bad.

803
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:58,434
 Whether the Klal Yisrael consists 
of sinners or saints. 

804
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,805
 We must accept the Klal Yisrael as it is, 

805
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,541
 and open our existence to the Klal Yisrael. 

806
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:11,647
 Any acts of dividing the Klal Yisrael, 
any acts of separating people, 

807
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,216
 of creating a sectarian philosophy. 

808
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:23,358
 Any acts which is out to 
promote and cultivate isolationism 

809
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:28,030
 and modern religious egocentrism 

810
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,865
 and self-righteousness 

811
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:34,336
 violates the principle of existential openness.

812
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,873
 Who is a king? 

813
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:41,076
 A Jew is, who opens himself up. 

814
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,445
 He opens himself up to the Klal Yisrael. 

815
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,515
 And embraces the entire Klal Yisrael, 

816
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:49,051
 without excluding anybody. 

817
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:57,626
 The king's existential openness 

818
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:01,063
 is both of a communicative 

819
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,932
 as well as a sympathetic nature. 

820
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:11,039
 That's what I call communicative 
existential openness, 

821
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:18,447
 when I remember that God's concern 
embraces everybody.

822
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:26,321
 But there is also, I mean, the 
Shechinah as I said before, 

823
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:30,759
 not only communicates with man, 
but suffers with him, 

824
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,694
 has compassion with him, 

825
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,631
 participates in his struggles. 

826
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,637
 So must the king's existence 

827
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,973
 be an open one not only in a 
communicative sense, 

828
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,543
 but also in a sympathetic sense.

829
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:50,812
Rambam, speaking of

830
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:55,250
the king, uses a very strange
term -- not term, phrase.

831
01:15:55,551 --> 01:16:01,857
"Mipnei shelibo lev kol
Yisrael." The heart of the king

832
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,292
 is the heart of the kehila.

833
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:09,197
Malchus requires of man not only to be

834
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:17,005
aware of the existence of others,
but to feel -- but also to feel, to

835
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:20,842
experience their existence, as if it

836
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,512
were his own.

837
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:32,888
In other words, malchus requires
of man to join and sit together to

838
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:40,762
share his ambitions, dreams, and
particularly pain and suffering.

839
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:41,997
As long as I am

840
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:54,209
just cognizant of the existence of fellow
man, I would just categorize as rei'a.

841
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,844
You know what rei'a in Hebrew is?

842
01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:02,951
Ki savo b'kerem rei'acha, ki
yigaf shor ish et shor rei'eihu.

843
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,019
Rei'a.

844
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:10,892
A comrade, an acquaintance, a neighbor,
sometimes a good one, sometimes a bad one.

845
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:15,263
Because the pasuk also says, ki
yakum ish al rei'eihu l'hargo b’arma.

846
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:19,534
If one should conspire to
kill his rei'a, his comrade.

847
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:25,307
He was a rei'a yesterday, yesteryear,
but now he is an enemy of mine.

848
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,543
Of course, I mean, in the
political community, I mean,

849
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,012
these changes take place.

850
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,185
I am just a rei'a, a neighbor.

851
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:43,091
The very instant, the very instant
-- the very instant I begin to

852
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:49,731
perceive -- not to know him but to
perceive him, to feel his existence,

853
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,768
experience his joys and frustrations, 

854
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:57,139
agony, and hope,

855
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,677
I turn from rei'a into what?

856
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,046
Into what?

857
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:05,580
Into a brother.

858
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,149
Into ach.

859
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:19,695
This higher degree of coexistence, of
interrelatedness and, and companionship.

860
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,036
A brother, 

861
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:32,174
what is a brother -- what
does brotherliness mean?

862
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,476
Existential unity.

863
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,479
One destiny.

864
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,781
One life.

865
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,349
One memory.

866
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,386
The precept of tzedakah

867
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:54,162
in Yahadus, of tzedakah and chessed, is
nurtured by the doctrine of sympathetic

868
01:18:54,162 --> 01:19:02,137
-- sympathetic openness, of a sympathetic
open existence, or by brotherliness.

869
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:13,081
While speaking of charity and of
tzedakah, the Torah constantly employs,

870
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:20,822
without a single exception, constantly
employs the term ach, not rei'acha.

871
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:27,963
Ki yamuch achicha, ki yihiyeh
becha evyon mei'achad achicha.

872
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:32,834
Never has the Torah used the term rei'a.

873
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,837
Because rei'a might

874
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:40,809
-- you see, when the Torah speaks about
civil law, not to inflict harm on

875
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,712
someone, so it employs the term rei'a.

876
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:47,549
The same thing, my neighbor imposes
a duty, an obligation upon me.

877
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:51,453
I should respect his property, respect
his rights, and not inflict -- and

878
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:55,390
I must not inflict any harm
or damages -- or damage on him.

879
01:19:55,757 --> 01:20:00,295
But this does not entitle the
rei'a to my support, that I should

880
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:06,802
share his troubles and be
helpful to him in times of need.

881
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:11,439
For that, the bond of rei'a is too weak.

882
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:16,344
You need a stronger bond,
that of ach, brother.

883
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:23,385
Maimonides, the Rambam, emphasized
the element of brotherliness

884
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,987
in, in conjunction with

885
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,189
the tzedakah.

886
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:37,499
One is obligated to help and to share with
the unfortunate one his woes and misery.

887
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:41,269
Because in tzedakah is not -- I
wanted to say, halachically,

888
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:46,241
tzedakah does not consist exclusively
of extending material help.

889
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:53,682
Sharing experiences, comfort, and,
and, and displaying sympathy and

890
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:56,151
compassion is a part of mitzvas tzedakah.

891
01:20:56,151 --> 01:21:01,556
At times, it's more important than the
material help I'd extend to someone else.

892
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:14,936
At this juncture, a new concept
of power in Yahadus emerges.

893
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:22,010
We said before that the Torah was
very reluctant about sanctioning

894
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:25,814
power and promoting unlimited power.

895
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:31,152
It has just reconciled itself with
historical realities and nothing

896
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:35,724
else, but the Torah considers
power structures as imperfect.

897
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:39,060
But there is one power structure,
whether they may call -- we should

898
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,897
call it a power structure or not is
a different problem, but there is one

899
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:46,101
form of power of authority which the
Torah sanctions -- not only sanctions,

900
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:53,008
recommended and stressed
the importance of it.

901
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:57,746
There is one form of power
or authority which Yahadus

902
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:01,182
sanctioned wholeheartedly; mainly,

903
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:09,958
the authority exercised by
the teacher over his pupil.

904
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:17,832
The relationship between a rav and talmid,
between teacher and pupil, or may I

905
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,335
use another word, master and disciple.

906
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:31,079
The commanding influence of the
master over his disciples was

907
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:36,484
accepted by the Torah without any
qualifications or reservations.

908
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,254
In fact, the

909
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:46,061
spiritual authority is quite
often superior to political power.

910
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:53,301
More, it endures longer and
is almost all inclusive.

911
01:22:54,469 --> 01:23:00,008
At times, spiritual authority
borders on the ultimate

912
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:04,913
and blind obedience.

913
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:07,515
Of course, I may make
the following remark.

914
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:12,854
This kind of power may
sometimes be misused and abused

915
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,723
by unscrupulous teachers.

916
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,959
Remember that.

917
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:29,571
And please don't suspect me if I
am preaching a -- a doctrine which

918
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:35,310
is convenient for me, which is
relevant to me, but this is -- this

919
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,212
is a central thought in Yahadus,

920
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,750
but, of course, the
teacher should be ideal.

921
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:52,227
The impact for instance, that the Baal
Shem Tov, had upon his disciples and

922
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:59,034
through them and the likes of hundreds
of thousands of Jews throughout two

923
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,570
centuries, can hardly be matched

924
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:09,277
by any ruler in the history
of the political community.

925
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:16,718
The same is true -- I mean, I
could mention many names, but the

926
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,720
same is true as the Gaon of Vilna.

927
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:25,860
The latter, I mentioned him because the
latter was a contemporary of Napoleon

928
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,262
-- he was just a bit older 

929
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,933
who has been considered

930
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:37,906
as the prototype of the man 
of the man of power.

931
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:42,243
as the prototype of the charismatic leader.

932
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:46,381
Warlord, legislator, and king.

933
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:54,789
Yet the -- yet the Gaon’s posthumous
authority outlives the death

934
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,792
of Napoleon and many others.

935
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:06,835
While Yahadus has been perturbed
about political power, 

936
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:12,874
it tried to limit its exercise
as much as possible.

937
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:20,115
it did encourage a disciple to give
boundless respect to his teacher,

938
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:26,754
the talmid to the rav, to listen
to him and to fulfill his wishes.

939
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:31,693
And do I have to quote many
maamerei Chazal in -- in order

940
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:34,629
to substantiate that statement.

941
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:35,763
What do you say?

942
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:42,804
Could someone suggest just one
maamar Chazal, which will suffice

943
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,740
-- I mean, to -- to clinch
it -- to clinch it up?

944
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:52,080
"'Es Adoshem Elokecha tira' l'rabos
talmidei chachamim," and take yourselves

945
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,251
talmidei chachamim is to be interpreted
in terms of teachers, rabbi muvhak,

946
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:59,654
his grand-teacher, who trained you.

947
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:04,425
"Thou shall fear the Lord, thy God,"
this precept also includes the norm to

948
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:09,063
fear and respect scholars and teachers.

949
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:17,071
God is not ready to share His
authority and power with the king,

950
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,574
with the political community.

951
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:28,149
However, He is willing to share his
authority, His power, with the spiritual

952
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,351
community and with the teachers.

953
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,123
Why?

954
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:44,098
His hameluchah v'hamemshalah is
jealous of being guarded for God.

955
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,801
Why did Yahadus surrender to the teacher?

956
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,705
Yahadus refused to surrender to the king,

957
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:54,242
To the greatest of all kings, but did

958
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:55,944
surrender to the teacher,

959
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,246
to the rav.

960
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:06,087
Two reasons lie at the root of the
Judaic glorification and idealization

961
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:08,256
of the teacher, of the rav.

962
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:15,797
First, the authority of the
rav is not imposed upon the pupil.

963
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:22,837
No political instrument is used.

964
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:27,775
No coercive action is undertaken

965
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:32,780
to force the authority of
the rav upon the pupil.

966
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:36,584
The talmid of

967
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:40,288
his own free will yields to
the authority of the teacher.

968
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:45,360
He joyfully so -- joyfully submits
to his -- to his way of thinking.

969
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:51,666
At times, the teacher felt -- feels
embarrassed by the deference of the

970
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:58,006
pupil and by the bad habit -- 
to imitate the teacher.

971
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:08,483
At times, while political authority
of the king is nurtured by fear,

972
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:15,723
spiritual authority of the rav is
rooted in deep affection and respect.

973
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,160
Teacher, yes.

974
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:27,201
Yes, teacher is a master like the king is
a master, but the mastery of the teacher

975
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:34,442
does not result in slavery of
the pupil, but in his freedom.

976
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:42,583
The mastery of the king principates
slavery of the subjects.

977
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:53,661
Second reason why Yahadus has
glorified the teacher, idealized him.

978
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:59,200
And God is ready to share His
authority, His power with the teacher.

979
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:05,139
Authority and ownership
are identical concepts.

980
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,843
Authority is vested in whom?

981
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:15,783
In the owner who can dispose
or reuse his property in any

982
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,518
arbitrary fashion or manner.

983
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:22,357
I can break it up, I can destroy it, I
can give it away, I can take it away.

984
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:26,327
I have full, unlimited
authority over my property.

985
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:37,939
The head of the political community

986
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,076
I mean, excuse me.

987
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:47,348
Yahadus has denied authority to the
head of the political community for

988
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:52,887
a simple reason: because the head,
the king, does not own his subjects.

989
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:55,957
They don't belong to him.

990
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,993
They are his equals in
the eyes of Yahadus,

991
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:03,398
whom he has no right to rule.

992
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:06,868
God's authority is boundless.

993
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,169
You know why?

994
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,539
Because He's the maker of all things.

995
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:14,809
That's why He rules all things.

996
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:22,750
He's the king of unlimited authority
because He is the creator of -- of many

997
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:27,522
things, of the endless and vast universe.

998
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,791
"La'Adoshem"...

999
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:37,265
However, in a very strange way, has
always looked upon the teacher, if

1000
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:42,203
not as upon a creator ex nihilo -- a
human being cannot create ex

1001
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:49,410
nihilo -- then, at least, as upon a
fashioner -- a fashioner, 

1002
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:52,280
an artisan,

1003
01:30:53,815 --> 01:31:01,656
who takes premortal matter and
impresses upon it a form upon it.

1004
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:09,297
Shape something amorphous into
something beautiful and fascinating.

1005
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:13,000
And Yahadus has said

1006
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:19,540
that the subject does not belong to
the king, but a pupil belongs to the teacher.

1007
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:26,547
because the latter trained him
and enlightened him,

1008
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,050
sensitized his heart

1009
01:31:30,918 --> 01:31:35,823
and molded his personality and
brought out his noblest and

1010
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,159
the finest and the best in him.

1011
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:42,029
And I want to add something: 

1012
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:46,767
The authority of the parent 
according to Yahadus is

1013
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:49,237
rooted in the authority of the teacher.

1014
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:53,975
The parent is a teacher and perhaps the
most outstanding teacher of the child,

1015
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:58,946
and that's why the child is [inaudible]
as partners who share the -- who share

1016
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:04,719
the child -- and they share the child,
Hakadosh Baruch Hu, aviv, v’imo.

1017
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:14,729
Yahadus considers talmud Torah or

1018
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:18,099
limud Torah, teaching the Torah, 

1019
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:26,040
as creative work and as a reflex of

1020
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:30,478
the infinite practice of creation
initiated by God 

1021
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,981
at the dawn of history.

1022
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:38,686
And which has never come to a close.

1023
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:47,595
God summons man to participate in this
great, wonderous drama of creation.

1024
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:55,269
The teacher, the rav, answers
the call and joins the Creator.

1025
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:58,472
Hence, he has a share in the student.

1026
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:05,413
He owns him because he's responsible
for everything the student stands for.

1027
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:15,156
And it's self-evident that
with ownership comes authority.

1028
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:20,695
"V'es ha'nefesh asher asu b'Charan."
I don't have to reach out too far.

1029
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:22,897
The souls which

1030
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,231
they made in Charan.

1031
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,433
How can you make a soul?

1032
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,901
Only God can make a soul.

1033
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,837
How could Abraham and Sarah
make souls -- create souls?

1034
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:36,310
So Chazal say, "Melamed sh'Avraham
m'gayer es ha'anashim," Abraham

1035
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:40,548
made these souls because -- because he
enlightened and taught them, "v'Sarah

1036
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:46,420
es ha'nashim," likewise did Sarah
participate in the creative gesture?

1037
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,357
Because she taught and enlightened people.

1038
01:33:55,663 --> 01:34:02,737
As a matter of fact, the creative,
didactic gesture -- the educational

1039
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:09,644
gesture of teaching consists in
the opening up of one's existence.

1040
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:11,946
It's not a mechanical practice.

1041
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,582
It's more a metaphysical practice.

1042
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:17,985
And I've been a teacher for
many, many years, 28 years.

1043
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:22,123
Bad teacher, a good teacher,
but I've been -- I mean, I try hard.

1044
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,494
It's very hard to get rid of me

1045
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,396
when I come into the classes.

1046
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:36,837
It does not consist in mechanical
testing on -- of information

1047
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:41,375
because if he’s just one who 
passes down information, 

1048
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,576
hands down information,

1049
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:44,045
He's a very poor teacher.

1050
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,781
I wouldn't hire him as a rosh yeshiva 
if I were the boss.

1051
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:59,393
It consists in the metaphysical,
or I would say, metapersonal

1052
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:08,736
process or gesture of opening up
one's existence, of letting the

1053
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:17,378
student share in the great spiritual
treasures stored up in the depths

1054
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:20,014
and the recesses of the teacher.

1055
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:28,122
One cannot teach unless he tears down
old barriers, separating individual

1056
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,958
-- individuals from each other, unless he

1057
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:35,229
is ready to establish an
existential community 

1058
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:39,867
[no audio] 

1059
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:41,736
its full realization.

1060
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:47,408
No wonder that Chazal spoke of Rabbanan,
"Man malchi," who are the king?

1061
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:49,944
Rabbanan, not because
they were very wealthy.

1062
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:56,150
We know chachmei Chazal lived
in poverty, in which, I mean,

1063
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,185
of scholars found themselves.

1064
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:00,688
Malki Rabbanan because

1065
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:07,027
they [inaudible] a -- exercise authority
-- authority which is nurtured by love.

1066
01:36:11,065 --> 01:36:16,670
As a matter of fact, let me come back
to the -- to the political community.

1067
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:22,510
The glorious -- tradition
of Malchus Beis David,

1068
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:29,784
which is supposed to find its
culmination in the King Messiah.

1069
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:34,321
Of course, it's a principal
tenant of our credo.

1070
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:42,763
Rests not upon the king at the
head of a political community but

1071
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:46,367
upon the king-teacher doctrine.

1072
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:49,737
Who is the Messiah?

1073
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,844
A politically powerful monarch?

1074
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:58,145
Certainly not.

1075
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,580
Who is he?

1076
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:07,621
A -- one whose authority
was established by force?

1077
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:09,657
Certainly not -- no.

1078
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:12,359
Who is he?

1079
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:19,633
The Messiah is a great, wonderous
teacher, prophet, who will

1080
01:37:19,633 --> 01:37:25,840
teach, instruct, enlighten, and
by so doing, redeem the world.

1081
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:30,377
I don't have to quote the Rambam for that.

1082
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,246
The Rambam is very explicit.

1083
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:38,185
"Mipnei sh'oso ha'melech" -- the Rambam
says in Hilchos Teshuvah -- "sh'yaamod

1084
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:47,962
mi'zera David baal chochmah yihyeh yeser
mi'Shlomo v'navi gadol hu karov l'Moshe

1085
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:54,268
Rabbeinu u'lefikach yelamed es kol
ha'am v'yoreh derech Adoshem v'yavo'u

1086
01:37:54,268 --> 01:38:00,007
kol ha'goyim l'shamo" -- [inaudible]
to Solomon and will be a great

1087
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:05,980
prophet of the Jewish people and
instruct them in the ways of God and

1088
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,848
all nations will come to hear him.

1089
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:13,087
As it is said, "And at the end of
days, it shall come to pass that

1090
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:17,157
the mount of the Lord's house
shall be established -- established

1091
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,827
at the top of the mountain. And

1092
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:24,298
we taught of His ways and we'll -- and
we'll walk in His path." 

1093
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:26,267
The Rambam

1094
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:33,774
couldn't have said it in more explicit
terms that the idea of malchus is the

1095
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:38,779
synthesis or the merger of king/teacher.

1096
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:45,953
And please, those who take philosophy
and take Plato, please don't confuse this

1097
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:48,522
theory with Plato's theory of the state.

1098
01:38:48,522 --> 01:38:51,992
There is no -- there's

1099
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:53,661
no common denominator.

1100
01:38:55,362 --> 01:39:01,802
Malchut -- I repeat, Malchut
achieves its complete realization

1101
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:04,571
in the teacher-king union.

1102
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:06,840
Not teachers' union but teach-king union.

1103
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:15,249
Let me just give you one example.

1104
01:39:15,816 --> 01:39:22,256
We have a rule in Talmud, "Moshe Rabbeinu
melech hayah," Moshe Rabbeinu was a king,

1105
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,758
halachically.

1106
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:26,593
There is a pasuk, basically.

1107
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:30,864
Of course, the pasuk could be interpreted
in two ways, but a Midrash interpreted

1108
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:31,832
the pasuk with reference to Moshe.

1109
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:36,971
"Va'yehi bi'Yeshurun melech b'hisasef
roshei am yachad Shivtei Yisrael." Why

1110
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,939
was Moses a king?

1111
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:49,116
And if Moses was a king, he was the
greatest of all kings in our history.

1112
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,218
Why was he a king?

1113
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:56,156
Because he was the greatest
teacher the -- the Jews ever had

1114
01:39:57,191 --> 01:40:00,794
and the greatest teacher is ipso facto

1115
01:40:00,794 --> 01:40:03,397
the greatest king.

1116
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:15,142
As a matter of fact, when the Gemara
in Brachos -- portrays David as

1117
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:17,378
a rosh yeshiva.

1118
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:20,447
David is off rendering halachic decisions.

1119
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:24,151
David -- David rising at
12 o'clock to study Torah.

1120
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:29,857
David -- David, I mean,
studying from Mefiboshes.

1121
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:37,831
It's actually what the Gemara says
in -- what is -- it's taken from

1122
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:43,971
"Tov li toras picha mei'alfei zahav va'chasef."

1123
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:49,276
Why did the Gemara, I mean, portray
David as the great talmid chacham,

1124
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:51,378
the great scholar, the teacher?

1125
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:56,683
Because without it, he wouldn't
have been the great king.

1126
01:40:57,584 --> 01:41:02,289
If David was a great king, it’s
only because he was a great teacher.

1127
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:07,961
And his objective was
not politics but scholarship.

1128
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:17,237
Now let me add something else.

1129
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:28,515
Yet, no matter how exalted the idea
of malchus is and exalted it is indeed.

1130
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:33,620
It must -- malchus
-- nevertheless, machlus must be

1131
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:41,728
dovetailed with another idea, namely
that of kedushah, kedushah u'malchus.

1132
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:48,469
Of course, malchus, when realized,
is grand -- is a grand experience.

1133
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:54,108
A closed-up -- what happens
to the malchus if realized?

1134
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:57,211
What happens to the person
who achieves kingship?

1135
01:41:58,312 --> 01:42:08,288
A closed-up sensing, self-oriented
-- ego-conscious and within-minded

1136
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:14,495
individual opens up toward the
outside, tears down old fences,

1137
01:42:15,395 --> 01:42:21,101
orientations, trends, it'll be a
gesture of magnanimity, spreads out

1138
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:25,772
his arm to embrace Klal Yisrael.

1139
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:39,052
Yet, in spite of the grandeur of
malchus, the realization is not

1140
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:45,159
complete if malchus does not need
kedushah and merge with kedushah.

1141
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:50,397
But what does it mean?

1142
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:53,400
How does malchus merge with kedushah?

1143
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:56,370
We have it in Yishtabach,
kedushah u'malchus.

1144
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:59,173
Where is the link between
malchus and kedushah?

1145
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:04,378
What -- what does the melech have
to do in order to acquire kedushah?

1146
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:08,081
He's already -- he's
aware of his assignment.

1147
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:12,886
He tries to meet the challenge of
history, to answer the summons of

1148
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:15,289
the hour -- of the historical hour.

1149
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,291
He opens up his existence.

1150
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:19,293
He tore down old barriers.

1151
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:21,695
He shed his selfishness, his egocentrism.

1152
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:25,299
He understands it.

1153
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:29,002
He understands everybody and
sympathizes with everybody.

1154
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:34,741
He is a teacher, a great teacher.

1155
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:41,715
So what else does he have to do in
order to achieve the pinnacle of malchus?

1156
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:50,857
The apex of malchus, where malchus and 
kedushah merge, become one idea.

1157
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:58,432
Which is the ultimate goal of
every Jew, which is the final destiny

1158
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:02,469
-- destination, rather, of every man?

1159
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:07,341
But how -- what -- what is
a melech supposed to do?

1160
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:11,411
Let me try to answer this question.

1161
01:44:12,379 --> 01:44:19,786
As we stated before, just a
while ago, Moses was a king.

1162
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:29,329
He was, as I said, the greatest of all
kings because he was the greatest of all

1163
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:33,133
teachers, the greatest of all prophets.

1164
01:44:36,803 --> 01:44:40,007
I would like to ask you one question.

1165
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:42,409
When did Moses become a king?

1166
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:45,279
Could you give me the date?

1167
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:54,054
When was the majestic crown
of malchus placed squarely by

1168
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:56,890
the Almighty upon Moses' head?

1169
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:04,164
Of course, the answer is simple;
when he stood before God on

1170
01:45:04,164 --> 01:45:07,701
Mount Sinai, not before that.

1171
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,673
How do I know it?

1172
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:18,111
How do we know that the crown was
placed upon Moses' head when he stood

1173
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:20,947
before his master on Mount Sinai?

1174
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:24,584
We say it every Shabbos.

1175
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:32,859
"K'lil tiferes v'rosho nasata lo b'omdo
lefanecha al Har Sinai," Moses rejoiced

1176
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:40,901
in the destiny bestowed upon him when
Thou did call him my faithful servant,

1177
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:47,774
placing on his head a crown of glory
as he stood before Thee on Mount Sinai.

1178
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:52,546
It means Moses was crowned
as king on Mount Sinai.

1179
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:54,481
It’s quite logical.

1180
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:58,418
Now, let me ask you another question.

1181
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:05,158
Moses stood before the Almighty, before
the Lord, at the top of the mount, three

1182
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:11,631
times -- at least two times or you could
(inaudible), but at least two times.

1183
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:18,338
When was he -- when was he crowned,
the first time or the last time?

1184
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:27,247
At the time of the first Matan Torah or
at the time of the second Matan Torah?

1185
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:28,849
What do you say?

1186
01:46:29,783 --> 01:46:32,185
Correct.

1187
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,559
We, of course, we all know the answer.

1188
01:46:39,559 --> 01:46:42,028
I wrote "We all know the
answer" before he answered me.

1189
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:44,030
We all know the answer.

1190
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:53,473
He was crowned when he stood before the
-- his master on the Mount Sinai -- on Mount

1191
01:46:53,473 --> 01:47:01,081
Sinai for the last time, for the master
God had delivered to him the Shtei Luchos

1192
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:09,756
Avanim, the two tablets of stone, the
so-called Luchot Shniyot, the second ones.

1193
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:18,298
We read just yesterday that before
Moses departed from Har Sinai,

1194
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:22,269
God made Moses' face radiate.

1195
01:47:23,203 --> 01:47:31,278
Only then was Moses appointed
and anointed and crowned as king.

1196
01:47:31,278 --> 01:47:33,680
By God, by the Almighty.

1197
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:39,286
"And it came to pass," the pasuk
says, "when Moses came down from

1198
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:48,328
the mountain," for the last time,
"that Moses knew not that the skin

1199
01:47:48,328 --> 01:47:50,730
of his face sent forth beams."

1200
01:47:51,832 --> 01:47:54,434
Again, a third question arises.

1201
01:47:54,434 --> 01:48:03,143
Why was he elevated to the stature
of the king only at the time of the

1202
01:48:03,143 --> 01:48:10,450
second Matan Torah, using the Jewish
calendar, our calendar, on Yom Kippur?

1203
01:48:11,184 --> 01:48:17,123
Why wasn't he elevated to kingdom
on Shavuos, at the time of -- the

1204
01:48:17,123 --> 01:48:24,564
first Matan Torah, when he confronted
the Almighty for the first time?

1205
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:30,537
What happened?

1206
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:37,978
During that destiny-charged period,
separating the second Matan Torah

1207
01:48:37,978 --> 01:48:43,950
from the first Matan Torah that
promoted Moses to king, to kingdom,

1208
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,920
to kingship, what happened?

1209
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,121
What event?

1210
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:51,725
You cannot say the confrontation with the
Lord because the confrontation took place

1211
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:54,327
the first time as well as the second time.

1212
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:59,699
There's no reason to consider the
second time superior to the first time.

1213
01:49:04,237 --> 01:49:08,942
You certainly know one of these
took place shviras ha'Luchos.

1214
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,945
The Luchos were shattered, nothing else.

1215
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:16,283
Shvirat ha'Luchos, the
Luchos were shattered.

1216
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:23,256
The two Tablets of the Testimony,
written with the finger of God, were

1217
01:49:23,256 --> 01:49:26,426
broken and shattered in a hurry.

1218
01:49:26,426 --> 01:49:36,369
In other words, Moses would have not
attained malchus if the tragedy of

1219
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:42,242
shviras ha'Luchos, the shattering
of the Luchos, had not occurred.

1220
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:49,349
Moses would have been -- if the
tragedy hadn't taken place -- a

1221
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:55,555
great prophet, the greatest of all
teachers, redeemer, but not king.

1222
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:04,931
Kingdom was bestowed upon him after the
first Luchos were -- had been broken.

1223
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:17,844
And God told him to hew two new tablets
of stone from a hard rock and told him

1224
01:50:17,844 --> 01:50:25,118
to climb the mount once again in order
to confront his Creator once more.

1225
01:50:25,352 --> 01:50:26,953
Why?

1226
01:50:28,588 --> 01:50:36,496
What did Moses lack before shviras
ha'Luchos that he had attained after that?

1227
01:50:38,164 --> 01:50:47,140
And how did this tragic and heartbreaking
event enhance Moses' personality and

1228
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:50,510
elevated him to the height of majesty?

1229
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:57,717
And I'll tell you what you're
asking and what he gained.

1230
01:50:57,717 --> 01:51:04,557
Moses, until the Golden Calf
episode, had never failed.

1231
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:06,393
Never.

1232
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:16,703
He was victorious until that time in all
his undertakings, he was the messenger

1233
01:51:16,703 --> 01:51:22,008
of fulfillment, the angel of realization.

1234
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:31,051
His message consisted of the joyous
words, for which the Jews were longing

1235
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:38,324
and yearning and waiting, "Pakod
padadeti es'chem," the double message

1236
01:51:38,324 --> 01:51:41,561
of the word, Chazal say, geula kefula.

1237
01:51:42,962 --> 01:51:48,835
This message was signed and sealed
by the Shem Havayah, not Kel Shadai.

1238
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:52,105
What does Shem Havayah symbolize?

1239
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:54,307
Fulfillment, realization.

1240
01:51:54,307 --> 01:52:02,415
Kel Shin -- Kel Shin-Dalet-Yud
symbolizes promise, waiting, long

1241
01:52:02,415 --> 01:52:04,417
waiting, ki ger yehiye zaracha.

1242
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:11,991
Of course, every promise will be
fulfilled, every -- every pledge will

1243
01:52:11,991 --> 01:52:15,729
be implemented, but you have to wait.

1244
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,131
This was the destiny of Abraham.

1245
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:19,733
Moses' destiny was different.

1246
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,636
God revealed Himself with
the medium of Shem Havayah.

1247
01:52:23,636 --> 01:52:27,640
Shem Havayah means immediate
victory, immediate realization,

1248
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,642
there’s no need to wait.

1249
01:52:30,844 --> 01:52:39,119
Shem Havayah means complete -- actually,
complete -- complete victory of

1250
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:44,290
a normal event, over the causal
nexus of a historical event.

1251
01:52:44,824 --> 01:52:48,928
He was the message -- he was the
fortunate prophet who brought

1252
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:51,898
with him the message of victory.

1253
01:52:53,466 --> 01:53:03,676
He was the prophet when God simply
radiated glory, the prophet of divine

1254
01:53:03,676 --> 01:53:15,688
openness and revelation; his authority
was not questioned, nor was it doubted.

1255
01:53:16,523 --> 01:53:19,492
"Vayaar Yisrael es ha'yad ha'gedolah
asher asah Adoshem b'Mitzrayim vayiru

1256
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:26,166
ha'am es Adoshem v'yaaminu ba'Adoshem
u'v'Moshe avdo," the pillar of fire,

1257
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:33,540
the pillar of triumph was marching in
front and the pillar of cloud symbolized

1258
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:36,943
protection and safety behind Moses.

1259
01:53:40,914 --> 01:53:49,489
Victory and malchus, in the opinion
of Yahadus, are two contradictory,

1260
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:53,426
mutually exclusive concepts.

1261
01:53:54,127 --> 01:54:00,767
As long as man is always victorious,
as long as man is always triumphant,

1262
01:54:00,767 --> 01:54:07,307
as long as his endeavors are blessed
with success continually, as long as

1263
01:54:07,307 --> 01:54:14,280
he continues to search ahead without
being stopped and made to retreat, he

1264
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:20,286
cannot attain malchus together with
kedushah, the highest degree of malchus.

1265
01:54:23,089 --> 01:54:29,696
Because malchus, in whose texture
kedushah is interwoven, cannot be

1266
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:38,571
attained if all battles are won, if all
undertakings are -- are realized -- are

1267
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:44,510
carried out, if all promises are
fulfilled and all dreams come true.

1268
01:54:46,746 --> 01:54:52,352
The king, in order to attain the pinnacle
of malchus, (inaudible) one must be

1269
01:54:52,352 --> 01:54:58,791
crushed, defeated, his aspirations
in shambles, his dreams, visions and

1270
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:06,900
hopes that he suppresses in order to
rise from that invitation and ascend

1271
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:10,570
the throne of majesty and kingship.

1272
01:55:11,504 --> 01:55:21,714
Moses could not achieve malchus as long
as his cause to greatness was straight,

1273
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:25,652
without alterations, angles or curves.

1274
01:55:25,652 --> 01:55:34,060
As long as there was continuous ascent,
upward movement, aliyah, when all

1275
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:39,365
aspirations were coming true, hope seen
to be in process of realization and

1276
01:55:39,365 --> 01:55:46,706
visions appeared to turn into reality,
Moses could not attain the pinnacle of

1277
01:55:46,706 --> 01:55:49,909
malchus and Moses couldn't be just a king.

1278
01:55:50,643 --> 01:55:56,349
He could be either the greatest of
all kings or he -- or nothing -- and

1279
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:59,452
not to -- or not to be a king at all.

1280
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:08,428
Only when the voice of God, "Lech reid,"
get thee down, "ki shicheis amcha,"

1281
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:10,830
for thy people have dealt corruptly.

1282
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:20,907
Thrust him back from his
heroically conquered, exalted

1283
01:56:20,907 --> 01:56:23,876
position and points of vantage.

1284
01:56:25,211 --> 01:56:30,950
Only when Moses realized that
he had failed, miserably failed

1285
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:33,286
in -- in the story of Matan Torah.

1286
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:38,891
His people he brought out of Egypt,
shicheis amcha, thy people, not my people,

1287
01:56:38,891 --> 01:56:41,294
were not ready for Kabbalas Ha'Torah.

1288
01:56:42,595 --> 01:56:51,337
Only then, when he -- in black despair
and desolation, he threw away the

1289
01:56:51,337 --> 01:56:58,911
Luchos and broke them, only then, he
was -- only when he was -- only when

1290
01:56:58,911 --> 01:57:07,887
he was rejected by God and also -- I
mean, denied, rejected by the people,

1291
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:11,991
only then he was anointed king.

1292
01:57:13,793 --> 01:57:15,395
It is God's will.

1293
01:57:15,395 --> 01:57:16,996
Why is it so?

1294
01:57:16,996 --> 01:57:24,370
It's God's will that man should
not achieve what he is meant

1295
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:30,009
to achieve without being once
defeated -- at least once defeated.

1296
01:57:30,276 --> 01:57:37,450
Without failing and losing his very
existential security or without

1297
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:47,727
relapsing to lower levels of being,
without experiencing hester panim, the

1298
01:57:47,727 --> 01:57:54,200
hiding of the face, for the mystics
of the Middle Ages used to call, the

1299
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:02,275
lonely dark night of the soul, without
finding himself in front of tightly

1300
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:08,181
closed gates of heaven and just hearing
the echo of one's own voice coming

1301
01:58:08,181 --> 01:58:11,918
back from dark, uncharted spaces.

1302
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:17,590
Shviras Ha'Luchos is an integral part 

1303
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:19,392
of human destiny.

1304
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:29,602
God decreed man to fail when He addressed
Himself to Adam and told him, "V'kotz

1305
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:36,943
v'dardar tatzmiach lach," thorns and
thistles shall it bring forth to thee,

1306
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:44,183
in the sweat of thy brow shall thou eat
bread 'til thou internment to the ground.

1307
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:51,390
Everybody, great or small,
is subject to God's dictum.

1308
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:58,131
None can escape and none can acquire
greatness, not even Moses, the greatest

1309
01:58:58,131 --> 01:59:05,171
and the most glorious of all teachers,
without experiencing defeat and failure.

1310
01:59:06,772 --> 01:59:14,914
Yahadus taught man not how -- not only
how to accept failure and not to get

1311
01:59:14,914 --> 01:59:23,523
lost, not only how to be defeated and
not to disintegrate, not only how to

1312
01:59:23,523 --> 01:59:30,329
be crushed and not to be overcome by
black despair or resignation but also

1313
01:59:30,329 --> 01:59:38,437
how to rise after one has been -- has
fallen, how to pick himself up, how

1314
01:59:38,437 --> 01:59:44,911
to pick up oneself up without help
after one has been thrown on the top

1315
01:59:44,911 --> 01:59:48,414
of the mount into the bottomless abyss.

1316
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:56,856
And Yahadus taught man how to assemble
patiently, the debris of the shattered

1317
01:59:56,856 --> 02:00:05,598
Luchos and restore their original
integrity or how to hew new tablets from the

1318
02:00:05,598 --> 02:00:17,577
hard rock and how to climb a steep mount,
rising above a black, gaping precipice,

1319
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:21,314
alone, how to replace one's 

1320
02:00:21,314 --> 02:00:34,527
[inaudible]
