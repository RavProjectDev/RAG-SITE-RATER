1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,736
Mr. President,

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:11,611
Roshei Yeshiva, worthy
rabbis, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:20,887
On behalf of Yeshiva University, it is my
privilege to welcome you this evening to

4
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:28,628
the third and final lecture of the three
lectures comprising the Benjamin Gottesman

5
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,965
Presidential Lectures in Jewish Thought.

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:41,374
It is a special delight to acknowledge
this evening the presence of Mr. and

7
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,577
Mrs. Benjamin Gottesman and family.

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,316
On behalf of all of us, I
welcome Mr. and Mrs. Gottesman

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:57,123
and wish to express publicly to
them our deepest gratitude for

10
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,925
helping make this evening possible.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:09,669
Tonight's lecture is also the Mrs. Tanya
Soloveitchik and Dr. Samuel Soloveitchik

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:16,276
Memorial Lecture, adding even more
significance to what, in any event,

13
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,615
is a spiritual and intellectual feat
without parallel in this generation,

14
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,986
namely, a public address by the Rav.

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,425
No introduction can do justice
to our speaker this evening.

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,130
One can, however, render kavod la'Torah.

17
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:43,103
And I can think of no more appropriate
way to do so than to call upon the

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:49,242
President of Yeshiva University, Rabbi Dr.
Norman Lamm, who will introduce the Rav.

19
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,610
President Lamm.

20
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,655
Kevod Maran Ha'Rav Shlita, 

21
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,061
distinguished guests,
members of the Gottesman family,

22
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,196
students, ladies and gentlemen.

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:17,704
Actually, as Dean Leiman pointed
out, these words of introduction are

24
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,305
superfluous; they're unnecessary.

25
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:27,547
Indeed, it's rather presumptuous for
anyone to introduce the Rav to an assembly

26
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:33,820
of lomdei Torah and shochrei Torah, but
there's something special about this

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,156
year's drashah, about this year's lecture.

28
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,262
"V'kidashtem es shnas ha'chamishim
shanah," we have to sanctify the 50th

29
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:47,267
year, the Jubilee year, and this is the
Jubilee year for the Soloveitchik family's

30
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,868
connection with Yeshiva University.

31
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,841
It was in 1929 that HaGaon Reb
Moshe Soloveitchik, 

32
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,276
zecher tzaddik livrachah, 

33
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,811
came here to teach.

34
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:06,352
And it is some 38 years, ad me'ah v'esrim
shanah, that the Rav has been marbitz

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,755
Torah b'rabim here at Yeshiva University.

36
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:16,529
And therefore, this is a special occasion,
and that is my excuse, my apologia for

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,202
daring to presume upon the Rav and upon
you to introduce him, albeit very briefly.

38
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:29,876
The Zohar tells us, in a most fascinating
passage, about Rabbi Shimon bar

39
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,278
Yochai on the day that he passed away.

40
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:37,617
"B'ha'hee yoma d'ba Rabbi Shimon
l'istalek min alma," the day that

41
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:42,055
Rabbi Shimon was about to depart from
the world, "va'hava mesader miloy,"

42
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:47,527
he prepared himself, arranged his
affairs, and "iskansu chavraya l'gabei

43
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,731
Rabbi Shimon," the colleagues, the
chachamim, the students, disciples

44
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:57,804
came to pay their respects to their
teacher, "va'hava malya beisa," the

45
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:05,245
house was full, there was no room to
move, "zakif Rabbi Shimon eino va'chama

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,583
d'ismalya beisa" -- can you hear me?

47
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,488
Rabbi Shimon -- too much.

48
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:22,028
Rabbi Shimon looked about and saw
that the house was filled, whereupon,

49
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:27,500
"bachah Rabbi Shimon," he began to
weep, and he said there was another

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,369
time that I was very, very sick.

51
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,873
And at that time, only one person
came to visit me, "hava Rabbi

52
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,810
Pinchas ben Ya'ir kamai," the great
disciple of Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi

53
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,646
Pinchas ben Ya'ir came to visit him.

54
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:48,454
And at that time, "is'char esha mi'kamai,"
he was enveloped in fire, "u'mei'almin la

55
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,357
ispasak," and that flame never left him.

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,295
"V'hashta," but now, I
see something different.

57
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:02,302
Now, I see that "ispasak." Now,
I see that the fire has left.

58
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,839
There is no longer any fire, "v'ha
ismalei beisa," but the house is full.

59
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,178
Rabbi Shimon wept when he saw
that he now had great popularity,

60
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,013
but there was no longer a fire.

61
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,051
And he preferred the is'char
esha to the ismalya beisa.

62
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,156
In the contest between contents
and fame, between passion and

63
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:29,362
popularity, the Zohar clearly chooses
is'char esha over ismalei beisa.

64
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:35,768
Better depth and content and
profundity than mere popularity.

65
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:43,343
I mention this because ashreinu u'mav tov
chelkeinu, how fortunate are we, not only

66
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,414
in this yeshiva, but in all the city, in
all the country, indeed, in all the world

67
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,552
-- we have here distinguished guests from
Israel as well -- that this last Yovel,

68
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:57,590
this last Jubilee, this last half century,
and especially under the tutelage and

69
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,564
leadership of the Rav, the last 38 years,
we have not had to choose, because we have

70
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:10,403
been blessed with both in the person of
the Rav, is'char esha and ismalei beisa.

71
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:16,376
We have is'char esha, the Rav's
depth, his gaonus, his ever-growing

72
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,977
creativity, which are legend.

73
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,447
And at this point, kol ha'mosif
gorei'a, I will say no more.

74
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,953
And at the same time, ismalei
beisa, the recognition by a very

75
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:32,191
grateful public, especially we of
Yeshiva University, who are all of

76
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,561
us, myself included, his talmidim.

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,866
Was his talmid, is his talmid
and hopes to remain his disciple

78
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,267
for many, many years to come.

79
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:47,206
Our prayer for the Rav is u'mei'almin
la ispasek, that he may continue

80
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:51,544
to be our teacher, to instruct
us, guide us, and enlighten us for

81
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,346
120 years.

82
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,755
Thank you very much.

83
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,759
I saw you have the mic and there
is an echo, there's feedback.

84
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,895
It's impossible to hear.

85
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,167
The topic is the

86
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:27,346
Haftarot, which we read on the
Shabbatot between Passover and Shavuos.

87
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:35,121
I would like to analyze a few
Haftarot and find the common

88
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,857
link or the common denominator

89
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,728
between the Haftarah
and the Parshas Ha'Yom.

90
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,366
The portion of Prophets

91
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:59,445
we read on the Shabbatot, on the
Sabbath, of the Shabbatot ha'shanah and

92
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:11,491
holidays, this portion is supposed to
address itself to an aspect which was

93
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,094
mentioned in the parshah, 
in the kri'as ha'parshah.

94
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,599
Maimonides distinctly

95
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:29,342
and explicitly mentioned that the
Haftarah should always concern itself 

96
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,646
with a motif

97
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:41,053
which we found in the
parshah during the kri'ah.

98
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:50,062
at the end of his siddur, he says,

99
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:59,405
m'ein ha'parshah, a Maftir
must treat a topic which 

100
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,342
was already mentioned 
by the parshah.

101
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:08,347
In other words, there is a common
denominator -- a requirement for

102
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:15,288
a common denominator, for a common
topic or motif in the parshah,

103
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,324
parshas ha'yom and in the Haftarah.

104
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,828
Let me say -- and

105
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:29,001
you know it, you don't need my
statement -- that it is not always

106
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,704
easy, it's not always simple

107
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:44,550
to find similarity, let alone identity of
themes in the Haftarah and in the parshah.

108
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,419
It's very difficult sometimes.

109
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:53,960
At times, we are simply baffled
by the choice of a particular

110
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,863
Haftarah, which prima facie

111
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,772
has absolutely nothing in common

112
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,009
with the parshah.

113
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:25,891
In such cases, an in-depth
analysis is indispensable.

114
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:32,031
As a matter of fact, lately, I simply
-- as it's just curiosity, perhaps.

115
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,866
It's just curiosity on my part,

116
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:42,108
inquisitiveness, but I have tried
in many cases to find this common

117
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:47,413
denominator in certain parshiyos
and the corresponding Haftaros.

118
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,183
In some, I have been very successful.

119
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,220
Some I could not find.

120
00:10:55,521 --> 00:11:00,326
In some, I couldn't find the common
denominator, and I plead ignorance.

121
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:09,402
It happened so that in Vayikra, lately,
while listening to the Haftarah recited

122
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:18,277
by the Maftir, my thoughts were centered
about this common motif or denominator

123
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,647
in the parshah and the Haftarah.

124
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:26,385
And I arrived at certain
conclusions and which I would

125
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,220
like to share with you tonight.

126
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:38,364
And somehow, it's a nice
service or it is a davar b'ito,

127
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,601
because the first part of my

128
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:47,673
lecture will revolve about
Yerushalayim and kedushas Yerushalayim.

129
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,975
Tomorrow night is Yom Yerushalayim.

130
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,079
Is it so, or you have forgotten?

131
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,184
It is, I believe.

132
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,053
We have Mr. Corner [ph].

133
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,790
Isn't tomorrow night Yom Yerushalayim?

134
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:14,900
May I add

135
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,639
that the results of such an
investigation, such an analysis

136
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,344
in the depths -- in-depth
are extremely gratifying.

137
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:36,722
We gain insights -- new insights
into the parshah and the Haftarah

138
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:48,000
At times, one sentence suffices
to establish the unity of motifs

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,902
in the parshah and the Haftarah.

140
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:50,836
One sentence.

141
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,372
At times, one word.

142
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,615
Whenever we detect 

143
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:08,454
the common motif in the parshah
and the Haftarah, we feel that a new light

144
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,557
-- in cases like that, a new, bright light

145
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:25,037
was cast upon the whole
parshah and the whole Haftarah.

146
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:31,177
Permit me to protect -- to present to you

147
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,380
two analytical studies.

148
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,551
Whether I'll be able to present
to you the second, I don't know.

149
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:43,556
It depends upon the clock, and I can't
see the clock here because of the lights.

150
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:53,465
And be careful, I mean, one takes a
risk if he comes into a hall where

151
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,534
I'm lecturing without a watch.

152
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,944
But anyway, the first one, I hope,
im yirtzeh Hashem, to conclude.

153
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:10,516
Yom Yerushalayim is
associated with the first one.

154
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:16,255
So, in Eretz Yisrael even may stay
at least [inaudible].

155
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:21,227
Permit me to present you
two analytical studies

156
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,130
embracing

157
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:33,505
several Haftaros we just finished reading.

158
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,912
The first study will concern
itself with four Haftaros.

159
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,354
Acharei Mos, Kedoshim,

160
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,690
Behar, Bechukosai.

161
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,192
We just read them.

162
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,393
Four Haftaros.

163
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,765
The second one, I hope I'll
have time to present to you,

164
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,801
is concerned 

165
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,741
with Emor and Tazria-Metzora.

166
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,915
There is topical unity in the Haftarot

167
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,787
of Acharei Mos,
Kedoshim, Behar u'Bechukosai.

168
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:31,163
There is also topical unity, thematic
unity in the Haftarot of Emor and Tazria.

169
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,606
May I ask for Chumashim?

170
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,174
Do you have a Chumash?

171
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,812
It's too heavy.

172
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:44,536
I wish to start with the
Haftaros of Acharei Mos and Kedoshim.

173
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,376
What Haftarah 

174
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
would I choose

175
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,454
for Acharei Mos and Kedoshim if
the choice had been left to me?

176
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,989
Of course,

177
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:11,230
I would say that if the choice had been
left to me, I would have chosen, selected,

178
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,600
two Haftarot.

179
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:23,042
For Acharei Mos, the Haftarah in
Yechezkel, Siman Chaf-Beis, 22.

180
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,045
"Va'yehi devar Adoshem elai leimor.

181
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:32,451
V'atah ben adam ha'sishpot
ha'sishpot es ir ha'damim,"

182
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:39,091
thou, son of man, would you sit in
judgment over the city of blood,

183
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:46,331
bloodshed, "v'hodatah es kol to'avoseha,"
and you'll inform the people of

184
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,302
the city about all the abominations

185
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,337
they committed.

186
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:58,343
It is most fitting for the Parshas Acharei
Mos because the Parshas Acharei Mos, the

187
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:08,053
last parshah, particularly, is concerned
with sex sins, with chet arayos and

188
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,925
also sheficus damim, bloodshed, 
avodah zarah, molech.

189
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:18,697
I mean, it would be a proper
Haftarah to be recited on the

190
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:23,402
Shabbat of Acharei Mos and Kedoshim.

191
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:31,210
Kedoshim, I would recite a
similar Haftarah also from Yechezkel,

192
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,248
 but treating the same topic.

193
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,418
"Vayehi devar Adoshem elai leimor.

194
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,122
Ben adam daber el ziknei Yisrael.

195
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:50,362
Ha'sishpot osam," will you sit in judgment
over them, "ha'sishpot ben adam es to'avos

196
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:58,137
avosam," will you sit in judgment over
them because of the abominations which

197
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,206
their parents or their ancestors were

198
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,043
engaged in or committed.

199
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,480
Those are the proper Haftaros.

200
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,051
As a matter of fact, in many Chumashim,
they are printed, those Haftaros.

201
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,889
In many shuls, in many batei knessios,

202
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:25,130
I discovered that still those two
Haftaros are being recited and read,

203
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,566
each one on its respective Shabbat.

204
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:32,938
Chaf on Acharei Mos,
Chaf-Beis on Kedoshim.

205
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:40,412
The Rambam, in his siddur, where he lists
all the Haftaros, also has for Acharei

206
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,116
Mos and Kedoshim two 
Haftaros from Yechezkel.

207
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,785
There was no problem.

208
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,726
However,

209
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:03,068
there are many communities, particularly
Lithuanian, many, many communities,

210
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,573
and also many poskim 

211
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:16,215
who recommended that the
Haftaros be replaced, the Haftaros from

212
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:21,220
Yechezkel be replaced by a Haftarah
from Amos, from the first prophet.

213
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:28,360
And instead of the Haftarah
dealing with the chet arayos, we

214
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:40,172
should read the portion from the
prophecy by Amos on both Shabbatot,

215
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:44,543
on Kedoshim and Acharei Mos.

216
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,749
And in a leap year -- if the year
is plain, so you read Acharei

217
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:56,221
Mos-Kedoshim at one time, so you
read Ki'vnei Kushiyim only once.

218
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:03,428
However, if the year is a leap year,
and Kedoshim and Acharei Mos are

219
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:09,801
separated from each other, so then
according to the minhag Lita, and

220
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:14,072
in accordance with many opinions
of poskim, gedolei Acharonim,

221
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,209
you read Ki'vnei Kushiyim twice;

222
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:25,751
on Shabbos of Acharei Mos, as well
as on the Shabbos of Kedoshim.

223
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:31,223
"Ha'lo ki'vnei Kushiyim atem
li Bnei Yisrael ne'um Adoshem

224
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:41,667
ha'lo es Yisrael he'eleisi mei'eretz
Mitzrayim u'Phlishtiyim mi'Kaftor

225
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,804
va'Aram mi'Kir."  We don't understand the relationship

226
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,974
of that portion of that prophecy

227
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,645
 to Acharei Mos, to the laws

228
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,217
and halachos formulated 

229
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,021
in the parshah of Acharei Mos or Kedoshim.

230
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,024
There is no similarity

231
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:10,062
at all between the
Haftarah and the parshiyos.

232
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,630
What is the reason, actually?

233
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,034
What is the reason that we replaced
the Haftaros from Yechezkel

234
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,504
with a Haftarah of Amos?

235
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,044
Of course, there is no mystery.

236
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,714
I mean, the answer is very simple.

237
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,716
At least the first answer is simple.

238
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:36,888
Then, another question arises, and we'll
have difficulty in solving this question.

239
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:38,990
There is no mystery at all.

240
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,329
There is a Baraisa in Megillah,
at the end of Megillah,

241
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,267
as well as in Mesechet Sofrim,

242
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,407
which quotes the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

243
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,578
Rabbi Eliezer says,

244
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:08,153
"Ein maftirin b'to'avos Yerushalayim,"
you should not recite the prophecies about

245
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:16,061
to'avos, the abominations of Yerushalayim,
"kol ikar," you don't mention them at all.

246
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,730
Neither for Acharei Mos, nor for Kedoshim.

247
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,832
We shouldn't.

248
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:29,741
"Ma'aseh b'echad" -- in Mesechet Sofrim,
as well as in the Gemara in Megillah, it

249
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:36,148
says, "Ma'aseh b'echad," it happened that
some individual, "haya korei lema'alah

250
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,549
m'Rabbi Eliezer," he was probably on

251
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,050
the second floor, Rabbi Eliezer
was on the street floor.

252
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,423
"Lema'alah m'Rabbi Eliezer," I
mean, geographically, as far as in

253
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:49,094
spatial terms, he was above Rabbi
Eliezer, "b'to'avos Yerushalayim,"

254
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,832
he recited the Maftir for Acharei
Mos or Kedoshim, 

255
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,037
the Haftarah from To'avos 
Yerushalayim from Yechezkel.

256
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:05,010
"Amar lo Rabbi Eliezer," so Rabbi
Eliezer told him, "reika," fool, "ad

257
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:11,950
sh'atah bodek b'to'avos Yerushalayim,"
you are so interested to indict

258
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,820
Yerushalayim of all crimes, "tzei u'vdok

259
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,691
b'imach," investigate your maternal
background, the family tree.

260
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:25,497
So, the Mesechet Sofrim says,
"U'matzo b'imo sh'hee pesulah," and

261
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:31,169
they found some p'sul as far
as the mother was concerned.

262
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:38,844
True, the Gemara in Megillah says,
"L'afukei mi'd'Rabbi Eliezer," the

263
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,512
halachah is not like Rabbi Eliezer.

264
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,983
That's what the Gemara in Megillah
says, but Mesechet Sofrim didn't say it.

265
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:49,588
Mesechet Sofrim quoted Rabbi
Eliezer, and apparently,

266
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,091
because he's in full
agreement with Rabbi Eliezer.

267
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,797
This means that according to Mesechet
Sofrim, is the halachah like

268
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,965
Rabbi Eliezer?

269
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,801
So, since the halachah is
like Rabbi Eliezer, so the two

270
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:08,373
Haftaros from Yechezkel, Chaf or
Chaf-Beis, are ruled out and they

271
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:15,847
are replaced by another Haftarah,
namely, K'vnei Kushiyim from Amos.

272
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,892
And as I said before, and we are

273
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:33,765
so careful and meticulous about
it that in a leap year, we read

274
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,802
the Haftarah of Amos twice.

275
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,609
Only a few Haftaros are read and
reread during the year, during the

276
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,312
annual cycle, but here it stopped.

277
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,713
A plain Haftarah is

278
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:56,454
recited for Acharei Mos and the
same is recited for Kedoshim.

279
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:08,199
Of course, we have accepted Rabbi
Eliezer's opinion that a Jew who

280
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:12,070
bought Maftir for $25 has no right to

281
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,307
criticize Jerusalem.

282
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:26,585
He has no right to repeat the
words of the Navi, of the Prophet.

283
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,893
And he should not charge Yerushalayim
with the Maftir, with crime, great sins

284
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,928
and transgressions and abominations.

285
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,697
He has no right.

286
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:48,273
The question here -- now, I mean, if
you could state the question, so that's

287
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:53,712
why we have replaced the Haftaros
of Achrei Mos-Kedoshim as far as the

288
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,013
nevuah of Yechezkel is concerned.

289
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,381
We don't recite it.

290
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,048
Fine.

291
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,619
Yeah, but there is still a question,
I mean, I haven't answered.

292
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,356
Why Amos?

293
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:04,856
Correct.

294
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,758
Why Amos?

295
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:15,900
Chazal, Chachmei Yisrael could've chosen
or selected another Haftarah which

296
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,139
has some similarity to the parshiyos

297
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:27,045
ha'Torah, which had
something in common with the

298
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,913
parshiyos ha'Torah, with the kri'a.

299
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,485
We have chosen the
Haftarah of the first Navi,

300
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:41,660
Amos, which, prima facie, at first glance,
there's absolutely no relationship to

301
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,832
whatever the Torah has formulated in
Acharei Mos and Kedoshim, not at all.

302
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:58,109
At first glance, not a single sentence
unites Amos with the parshiyos

303
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,645
Kedoshim and Acharei Mos in the Torah.

304
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,717
The answer, I believe, is obvious.

305
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,152
It's not difficult.

306
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,629
Both sidros -- that means
Acharei Mos and Kedoshim

307
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,702
-- told the people something

308
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,672
which frightened them.

309
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,944
They addressed to the 
people for the first time

310
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:42,787
since they left Mitzrayim, for the first
time, something frightening, horrifying.

311
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,791
Namely, what?

312
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,599
That there is a possibility, and perhaps not
only a possibility but a probability

313
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:01,873
or perhaps a certainty, that in
the future, they'll lose the land

314
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:11,750
and they will be exiled from
their ancestral land 

315
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:18,356
into an endless, bleak 
and dreary galut.

316
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,597
There is a reality,

317
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,501
which we call galut, that was
disclosed to the people in Acharei

318
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,870
Mos and Kedoshim for the first time.

319
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:40,078
The Torah says for the first time
-- later, the Torah repeated this warning

320
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:45,483
of what the Acharei Mos-Kedoshim -- the
people to whom Acharei Mos-Kedoshim

321
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:51,055
was revealed through Moshe, by Hakadosh
Baruch Hu through Moshe, were taken aback.

322
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,324
What did they hear?

323
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:59,063
They heard a few sentences, which
they did not understand a word and

324
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,833
they got frightened, horrified.

325
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,334
What happened?

326
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:08,807
"Ki es kol ha'to'eivos ha'eil,"
all those abominations, "asu

327
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,242
anshei ha'aretz asher lifneichem,"

328
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:19,150
were committed by the people of
the land who preceded your coming

329
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,858
to the land, "va'titma ha'aretz,"
and the land became defiled.

330
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,563
"V'lo saki ha'aretz

331
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,266
es'chem," and the land
should not vomit you out,

332
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,068
cast you out.

333
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:50,415
This is in Acharei Mos,
Vayikra Chaf-Teis, Chaf-Cheis.

334
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,617
Then in Kedoshim,

335
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:58,389
"U'shmartem es kol chukosai v'es kol
mishpatai va'asisem osam v'lo saki

336
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:02,594
ha'aretz," the same expression, the same
idiom, "v'lo saki ha'aretz es'chem," the

337
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:06,030
land will not throw you up, vomit you out.

338
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,199
It's a very strange word.

339
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:15,240
"Asher ani meivi es'chem shamah la'sheves
bah," to which I brought you in order to

340
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,076
live there for many, many, many years.

341
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:25,383
But should you commit those abominations,
so the land will simply shake you off.

342
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,655
As a matter of fact,

343
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:39,731
the Torah emphasizes that exile
from the land, or departure from the

344
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:45,203
land, in such a case, is a natural

345
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,375
phenomenon, not a penalty.

346
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:54,312
It is a phenomenon which
can be explained in

347
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,548
terms of cause and effect.

348
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,052
In causal terms, it could be understood.

349
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:07,659
It's not a special onesh imposed
upon the Jewish people, but it is

350
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:14,232
an -- it is a result of certain
behavior on the part of the people.

351
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,575
It is almost -- I mean, it fits
into the scheme of causality,

352
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,277
of cause and effect.

353
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,920
The land in words -- the land
does not tolerate immorality,

354
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:44,262
particularly immorality of
arayos and murder and bloodshed.

355
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:51,936
And it casts off the people who defile
themselves with such abominable deeds.

356
00:32:53,237 --> 00:33:01,212
The way Rashi says, a prince with
a very delicate digestive system

357
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:10,288
will throw up if he'll be fed
food which is slightly spoiled.

358
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,393
Eretz Yisrael is a very delicate,

359
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,597
a very tender land.

360
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,334
It does not tolerate every aveirah.

361
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,436
It does not tolerate it.

362
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,704
It shakes them off.

363
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,042
You don't have to be punished for that.

364
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,511
It's simply the soil.

365
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,749
The particles of the soil
shake off every aveirah.

366
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:44,722
Rashi says, "Mashal l'ben
melech sh'he'echiluhu

367
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,760
davar ma'us sh'ein omed

368
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:59,370
b'mei'av u'meki'o kach Eretz
Yisrael einah mekayemes aleiha ovrei

369
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,540
aveirah." This is what Rashi says.

370
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:09,981
Like the prince who throws up if he
was fed something which was spoiled or

371
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:16,020
not the best or finest quality, because
he has a delicate digestive system,

372
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,991
so is Eretz Yisrael very sensitive.

373
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:25,663
Certain aveiros in chutz
la'aretz are differently assessed

374
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,333
than they would have
been in Eretz Yisrael.

375
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:36,174
Eretz Yisrael not as a ben melech but
a bas melech, very, very delicate,

376
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,143
very tender, very meticulous.

377
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,214
And galus is not a punishment.

378
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,150
It is the natural consequence of cheit.

379
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:50,021
That's what Rashi wanted to explain.

380
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,499
Nu?

381
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,534
So what?

382
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,040
And this the people
heard for the first time.

383
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:15,546
They heard that Eretz Yisrael
casts off, casts out sinners

384
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,751
or those who defile themselves
and defile the land

385
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,086
with their deeds.

386
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:35,433
So, wouldn't you say that the Chachamim
who actually dealt with this problem

387
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:39,804
of a Haftarah to choose the proper
Haftarah for Acharei Mos and Kedoshim

388
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,809
faced -- what shall I say -- a dilemma?

389
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,614
There were two possibilities.

390
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:59,790
One possibility is that the topic,
the theme of Kedoshim and Acharei Mos

391
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:10,434
should be, I mean, the laws pertaining
to arayos, to avodah zarah, to murder.

392
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:21,812
In Kedoshim, the laws pertaining
to Shabbos, to Kibud Av va'Em.

393
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,714
They could have

394
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:31,756
found such a prophecy or a portion
which would correspond, which would run

395
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:38,095
parallel to those basic laws which are
mentioned in Kedoshim or Acharei Mos.

396
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:43,401
Rashi, at the beginning of
Kedoshim, says this parshah includes

397
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,070
"gufei Torah," the very tenets 

398
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,174
of our Torah.

399
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:56,514
So, it was quite possible, I mean,
to choose some chapter in Isaiah or

400
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:01,819
in Yechezkel or any other book of
Prophets which would correspond, 

401
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,657
would run parallel to 
the gufei Torah which

402
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:12,930
were formulated in Kedoshim
as well as in Emor.

403
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:19,237
There's another -- this is one
alternative, one possibility, but the

404
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:25,376
Chachamim had another possibility,
namely, to declare the central theme

405
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,278
of Acharei Mos and Kedoshim 

406
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,746
is

407
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,582
galus.

408
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:39,156
The central theme consists in this
sentence: "V'lo saki ha'aretz es'chem."

409
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,526
We have the Maftir has got to react

410
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:49,700
to that theme, to the theme of
galus, which was new, something

411
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,504
new and incomprehensible to them.

412
00:37:55,206 --> 00:38:03,347
The Chachamim had the choice either
to prefer the gufei Torah and declare

413
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,852
them as the central theme of Kedoshim,
and then fashion the Haftarah in

414
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,588
accordance with the gufei Torah.

415
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,758
"V'lo sechakashu v'lo
seshakeru. V'lo sishavu bi'shmi

416
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,160
la'shaker." Important mitzvos.

417
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,263
"Ish imo v'aviv tira'u
v'es Shabbsosai tishmoru.

418
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,000
Lo salin pe'ulas sachir it'cha ad boker.

419
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,403
V'ahavta l'rei'acha kamocha.

420
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:32,843
V'yareisa Adoshem Elokecha." Those
laws, tenets, principles of morality,

421
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:37,048
the basic principles of morality,
could have become the central theme

422
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,419
of Kedoshim, and the Haftarah would
have been fashioned in accordance with

423
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:47,091
those principles, would correspond to
those -- with those principles. However,

424
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,260
the Chachamim decided differently.

425
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,396
If the Haftarah "Ha'lo ki'vnei

426
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:57,735
Kushiyim atem Beis Yisrael " is

427
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,570
accepted, so what is

428
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,905
the central theme?

429
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:06,243
What is the central theme
of Acharei Mos and Kedoshim?

430
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,511
What?

431
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,048
Galus.

432
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,119
And how to avoid it, the Haftarah should

433
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:15,820
answer how

434
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,254
to avoid galus,

435
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,791
how not to be trapped by galus.

436
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:25,663
Not to be confronted
by that curse of galus.

437
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,599
And if, Rachmana litzlan, chas v'shalom,

438
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:36,340
a Jew should be exiled from his
land, how to get back to the land.

439
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:47,418
And that is why Chazal chose
the Haftarah from Amos.

440
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,354
He gives the answer, Amos.

441
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:59,697
Before Isaiah and before 
Yirmiyahu and before

442
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:03,601
Yechezkel, Amos proclaimed 

443
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:10,374
the emunah,
our faith in shivas bnei ha'golah

444
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:17,782
l'Eretz Yisrael, in the returning of our
people from captivity to Eretz Yisrael.

445
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:28,692
And they chose the Haftarah of -- the
portion of Amos, from Amos' prophecy,

446
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:34,498
which is most characteristic for "V'lo
saki ha'aretz es'chem" -- I mean, most

447
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:41,005
characteristic and the most direct,
which has a direct -- I would say, 

448
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:53,484
A direct approach to the curse of galus
which was mentioned in the parshah.

449
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:59,256
"V'shavti es shvus ami
Yisrael," and I will return,

450
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,658
I mean,

451
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:06,964
from captivity my people, Yisrael,
"u'vanu arim neshamos," and they'll

452
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,202
build waste cities or desolate cities,

453
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:17,575
"v'yashavu," and they'll settle
there, "v'natu keramim v'shasu es

454
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:21,445
yeinam," and they'll plant vineyards
and they'll drink the wine up.

455
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:29,253
"U'neta'atim al admasam," I'll plant
them on their land, but this time a

456
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:37,561
little -- in a different manner than
I planted them before, "v'lo yinat'shu

457
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:43,601
od mei'al admasam," they will not be
removed from the soil in which I shall

458
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,537
resettle them, "amar Adoshem Elokecha."

459
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,641
Isn't this the answer to "V'lo saki
ha'aretz es'chem… 

460
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,580
ka'asher ka'ah es ha'goy

461
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,082
asher lifneichem"?

462
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,851
Isn't Amos the answer?

463
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,355
Is Amos m'ein ha'parshah or not?

464
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,157
Of course, it's m'ein ha'parshah.

465
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,296
[Break in audio]

466
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,366
...galus is.

467
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,401
God will not destroy the people.

468
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,605
He may cast out His people from their land

469
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,908
for a short while, yet He

470
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,577
will bring them back from captivity.

471
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:33,217
We will have to have a painful absence,
strike roots again in the land, and

472
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,186
we'll never be severed from the land.

473
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,994
Could you tell me what is actually --

474
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:50,367
what motivated Chazal to choose just one

475
00:42:50,367 --> 00:43:00,144
pasuk in Kedoshim and Emor and then
the Haftarah revolve about this pasuk

476
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:11,055
instead of, I mean, choose -- selecting
the gufei Torah in Kedoshim and in

477
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:19,396
Emor and find the appropriate Haftarah
which will fit those gufei Torah?

478
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,933
We all know why it is
so, why they chose it.

479
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:33,911
Because the people, in the
time of Chazal, when -- I mean,

480
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:38,616
needed support and encouragement.

481
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:47,124
And, particularly, they had to
believe that all the persecutions,

482
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:53,330
that the galus is just a temporary,
transient phenomenon, Hakadosh Baruch Hu

483
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,200
will finally bring them back.

484
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:03,474
The emunah b'bias ha'Mashiach would
have been undermined if Chazal hadn't

485
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:18,889
selected the last pasuk in Amos as the
response to the warning of galus, which

486
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,259
Moshe addressed to the people.

487
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,664
Yes, the people might be exiled.

488
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:33,871
They might lose their land and everything
which they shared, and everything

489
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:39,176
which was dear and holy to them, but
this is just a transient phenomenon.

490
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,415
They'll come back to the land, and
whatever they lost will be recovered.

491
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,419
And, of course, it

492
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,722
is -- galus is bad, even if it's

493
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:58,162
transient and short-lived,
just a short experience.

494
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:02,833
However, the final destiny of the Jew will

495
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:08,605
be fulfilled, the way Amos
foresaw and Amos predicted.

496
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:26,223
At this point, we encounter the very
principle which lies at the root of

497
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,959
the Haftarah institution in general.

498
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:32,496
See, we have two institutions.

499
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:37,568
We have krias ha'Torah, and we
have the Navi, krias ha'Navi.

500
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,838
What's the difference between
those two institutions?

501
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:45,342
Krias ha'Torah was simply introduced in
order to acquaint the people with the

502
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:49,413
Torah, to acquaint them with the laws.

503
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:55,919
You know, I mean, in the time of Chachmei
ha'Talmud, they had a meturgeman who

504
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,857
used to explain and tell them what

505
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,458
the laws are.

506
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,829
This was first.

507
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,566
Then, the Haftarah was introduced
for a different reason.

508
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:15,472
As far as the law is concerned,
"Sh'ein ha'Navi rashai lechadesh

509
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,709
davar," a Navi cannot add anything,
I mean, to the system of law

510
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:25,015
which was given to us by Hakadosh
Baruch Hu through Moshe, through Moses.

511
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:33,123
The nevu'os, the institution of Haftarah

512
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,792
was introduced for a different purpose.

513
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,161
Namely what?

514
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:44,835
To strengthen the faith of the people in
the final redemption and the final return

515
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,938
to Eretz Yisrael of the Knesset Yisrael.

516
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:52,810
One word. the Haftarah
serves -- the Haftarah reminds

517
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,113
the people of bias ha'Mashiach.

518
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,984
And if you want, I mean, you may
ask me how did I arrive at this conclusion?

519
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,286
What do you say?

520
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:08,992
Because if you read the brachos of
the Haftarah, so you will realize

521
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:16,600
immediately that all the brachos revolve,
circle around one article of faith.

522
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:23,207
Remember, "V'davar echad mi'devarecha
achur lo yashuv reikam ki melech ne'eman

523
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:28,579
v'rachum atah." Whatever You promised will
come true, that the great eschatological,

524
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,249
Messianic promise will finally be realized.

525
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:40,691
No matter how difficult times were, no
matter how difficult it was to believe

526
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:48,298
in the final restoration of all its
glory and the fulfillment of all hopes,

527
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:55,539
nevertheless, in spite of all the
difficulties, the promise of Hakadosh

528
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,609
Baruch Hu to His people will come true.

529
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,111
And here we have the problem.

530
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,581
On the one hand, the people
listened to krias ha'Torah,

531
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,783
and the people got frightened.

532
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,385
They couldn't understand.

533
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,688
The land to which they are
marching -- after all, they were on

534
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:16,560
their march from Mitzrayim to Eretz
Yisrael -- will be given to them

535
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,328
just for a short while.

536
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,566
If they should commit sins -- and
they knew very well that sins

537
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,368
are going to be committed.

538
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:28,805
A man is just -- he's unlimited
in his freedom, in his choice.

539
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,342
If they should commit 
the sins, they'll be

540
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,045
cast off -- cast out of the land.

541
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,048
They'll be vomited out of the land.

542
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,417
So,

543
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,619
why Mitzrayim?

544
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,789
Why yetzias Mitzrayim?

545
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,257
Why Matan Torah?

546
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,226
They couldn't understand it.

547
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,331
And what could, I mean, the
people -- the contemporaries of

548
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,267
the Chachmei ha'Talmud understand?

549
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:03,974
So, that's why the prophecy by Amos
was introduced: to tell the people

550
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:09,212
no matter how bad galus is and no
matter how severe the punishment

551
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,149
will be -- as a matter of fact,
there would be no need to punish.

552
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,117
It's a natural consequence.

553
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,852
Galus is a natural consequence of sin.

554
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:21,124
Sin and Eretz Yisrael are
somehow mutually exclusive, yes.

555
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:30,367
No matter how difficult, the
final destiny will be realized.

556
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,838
And this destiny would be the Jew will be planted in Eretz Yisrael,

557
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,207
not for a short time,

558
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:44,848
not as a transient or just as a temporary
guest or visitor in Eretz Yisrael,

559
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:52,923
but he'll be planted in a manner
that he'll become a part of the land.

560
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,059
And, "v'lo yinat'shu

561
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:59,896
od mei'al admasam," they will
never be removed from the land.

562
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:06,503
In the interest, the whole Haftarah
serves the same -- this purpose, to

563
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:12,843
assure the Jew of the final realization
of all the promises given to him by God.

564
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:20,617
And this was the best place where the
Jew was -- should have been reminded

565
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:29,626
that in spite of the martyrdom we will
have to experience, the final destiny

566
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:36,800
of ours, which is combined with Eretz
Yisrael, will be fulfilled and realized.

567
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:46,743
So, what is the m'ein ha'parshah
as far as Acharei Mos and

568
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,612
Kedoshim are concerned?

569
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,980
What's the m'ein ha'parshah?

570
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,882
Where is the parallelism,

571
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,450
the similarity?

572
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,419
Galus and geulah.

573
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,487
Temporary galus

574
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,556
and permanent geulah.

575
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:03,593
If you take the pasuk in Acharei
Mos-Kedoshim and you compare it with the

576
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:09,933
few pessukim in Amos, so you arrive at
the m'ein ha'parshah consisted in having

577
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:19,109
assured the people that the galus will
be short, the geulah will be forever.

578
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,215
And may I add a
personal -- something personal?

579
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:30,187
It took me months until I unraveled that.

580
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,855
I couldn't understand.

581
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,724
Finally, it dawned upon me.

582
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,060
This is the law.

583
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:42,833
This is the last part of Amos, "v'lo
yinat'shu od mei'al admasam." That's

584
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:51,708
what made this parshah, as not to say
-- which converted, actually, the Haftarah,

585
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,512
instead of condemning the people for

586
00:51:55,512 --> 00:52:03,019
abominations, the Navi, I mean,
brings words of solace and

587
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,722
encouragement and faith to the people.

588
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,401
Now, I'm expecting a question.

589
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,105
Yeah, expecting a question.

590
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,943
Is it all right?

591
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:31,448
Is everything so smooth that
there's not a single question?

592
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:48,865
What?

593
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,201
[Inaudible]

594
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:56,673
Because the galus is mentioned twice
in Acharei Mos and Kedoshim, so we read

595
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,944
the same Haftarah on the Shabbos of
Acharei Mos and the Shabbos of Kedoshim.

596
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:09,419
We don't want that the warning
of galus be read without reacting

597
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,289
or without responding to it.

598
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,324
That's why

599
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:20,463
the very moment we read about the
possibility of galus, we right away

600
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:25,802
-- because the "v'lo saki ha'aretz es'chem"
is at the end of the parshiyos, at

601
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:30,207
the end of Acharei Mos and the end
of Kedoshim -- right away we respond.

602
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:36,813
Yes, it will happen, but God will
return the people from captivity to

603
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,883
Eretz Yisrael, and that time forever.

604
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,751
They'll stay in Eretz Yisrael forever.

605
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,758
I want you to know I'm not
speaking like a Zionist.

606
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,163
I don't preach Zionism.

607
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,599
This has nothing to do with Zionism.

608
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,001
This is guf ha'shoter.

609
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,485
There is another problem
which you have to solve.

610
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:25,095
Namely, the Navi did not say
how the Jews will come back.

611
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,529
What will make

612
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,065
them return?

613
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,701
And did not

614
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:40,343
-- the Navi did not tell us what -- whether
or not the land will wait for us.

615
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,713
Perhaps, the land will not wait for us.

616
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:50,186
It could be occupied, invaded,
cultivated and developed into a civilized

617
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:53,657
country without our participation.

618
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,360
It was a historical possibility.

619
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,602
How is a return to the land which

620
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:16,846
vomited out its inhabitants 1,900 years
ago -- because they defiled themselves

621
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,684
and as well as her -- possible?

622
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,353
How is such a return possible?

623
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:32,595
Does the land wait so long for
her children to come back the way

624
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:38,368
a loving mother waits the return
of her child, of her only child,

625
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:43,406
or the land is not as tender,
not as loving as a mother is?

626
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,947
What guarantees the return
of the children to the land?

627
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,350
There's a question that's
basically a double question.

628
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:59,923
Does the land wait for her children,
and do the children want to come back?

629
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,492
It's a double question.

630
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,094
It's not one question.

631
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,164
There's no answer in Amos about it.

632
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,933
There's no answer.

633
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:14,671
In Amos, there is promise,
pledge, havtachah.

634
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:19,242
Yes, but Amos does not explain to us how.

635
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,312
What is the guarantee?

636
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:29,819
What will make the bond so permanent
and strong between people and land?

637
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,491
What is responsible for

638
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,226
the patience

639
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:44,601
which the Knesses Yisrael, on the one
hand, and the land, Eretz Yisrael, on

640
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:54,878
the other hand, will wait or will expect
the return of the children to the land?

641
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:03,653
I believe that answer -- this answer
lies in a halachic category.

642
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,088
This is my opinion.

643
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,923
I have thought about it a lot.

644
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,327
I believe this

645
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:16,299
is to be found -- the answer is to
be found in a halachic category.

646
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,736
Namely, what would you suggest?

647
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:23,072
Which category in a halachic term,

648
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,242
Namely, what?

649
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,444
What guarantees?

650
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,281
Where is the -- document, the shtar?

651
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,083
I said halachic term.

652
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,922
I mean, it's a very simple word.

653
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:42,192
I mean, I haven't discovered anything new.

654
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:48,665
Namely, that somehow our
rights to Eretz Yisrael.

655
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,067
We have rights, that's
at least what people say.

656
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,370
We have a right to the land.

657
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:59,008
We are the rightful owners of the land.

658
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:05,148
As well as our rights to the
Beis Hamikdash, to the Har

659
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,217
Habayis or to Yerushalayim.

660
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:11,387
And by the way, again, it's not Zionism.

661
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,289
This is Torah Sh'be'al Peh.

662
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:19,629
Let me say, according to the
halachah, Yerushalayim is not a city.

663
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:24,133
It's called Ir David, yes, but
al pi halachah, it is not a city.

664
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,604
Yerushalayim is a part of the Beis Hamikdash.

665
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,507
It’s one kedusha.

666
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,909
Shalosh machanos hen Yisrael.

667
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:41,251
In the midbar, the people were divided
into three camps: Machaneh Yisrael, the

668
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:48,091
camp of the Israelites, of the ordinary
Jews; Machaneh Levi, Leviyah, of the camp

669
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:55,331
of the Levites; and finally, Machaneh
Shechinah, the camp where God resides.

670
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:59,168
Yerushalayim is Machaneh Yisrael;
it's a part of the Beis Hamikdash.

671
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,372
Our claims to Yerushalayim are not

672
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:10,046
only based on the promise which
the Almighty gave to Abraham

673
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,983
with regard to Eretz Yisrael.

674
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:24,594
Not only on that promise, but it's also,
I mean, based upon the parshah, Re'eih,

675
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:31,167
"l'shichno tidreshu u'vasa shamah," you
will detect the place where He resides,

676
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,969
and to that place you will be coming.

677
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,073
Yerushalayim is actually two

678
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,409
-- there are two kedushos to Yerushalayim.

679
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:47,450
Kedushas ha'aretz, the kedushah
which pervades the entire land, its

680
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,853
entire topography and geography.

681
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:58,161
And secondly, kedushas ha'mikdash,
the kedushah which pervades the Har

682
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,964
Habayis as well as Yerushalayim.

683
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,199
Different types.

684
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:12,642
With Eretz Yisrael, our right to Eretz
Yisrael as a land or to Yerushalayim

685
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:20,950
not only as a city but as a part
of the Beis Hamikdash, our right to

686
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,519
both the land as well as Yerushalayim

687
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:28,491
is based upon one word: kedushah.

688
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,127
Without kedushah, we have no right.

689
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:38,201
If someone should deny kedushas ha'aretz
or should deny kedushas Yerushalayim,

690
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,602
to say the land is a land like

691
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:44,707
any other territory, and Yerushalayim
is just a city and the Har Habayis

692
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:51,614
is just a just a hill or -- nowadays,
it is a valley, you go downstairs

693
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:58,454
in order to get to Har Habayis,
that there is nothing unique,

694
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:02,291
there is nothing singular about the

695
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,994
land and Yerushalayim.

696
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,899
So, by making that statement, he
forfeits all rights to Yerushalayim

697
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,502
and to the Beis Hamikdash.

698
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,637
It's a question of kedushah.

699
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,075
Now, there is a plain problem with
which the Baalei Tosfos preoccupy

700
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,078
themselves, as well as many Rishonim.

701
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:28,351
But the most outstanding Rishon who
actually introduced a new concept, a new

702
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:34,290
perspective with regard to that problem
of kedushah, is Maimonides, the Rambam.

703
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,126
Excuse me, I'm assimilated.

704
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,304
You can't resist the galus.

705
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,379
There is a question, let me ask.

706
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:01,184
I'm trying to develop Maimonides'
idea, but I'll change the

707
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,319
vocabulary a little bit.

708
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:11,094
There is a question which
should be formulated properly

709
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,696
and answered courageously.

710
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:20,369
Are churban and kedushah, two good
words -- I mean, two words in the

711
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:26,943
Hebrew language -- churban u'kedushah,
two mutually exclusive categories?

712
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,078
Two opposites?

713
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,849
They contradict each other.

714
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,660
Desolation

715
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:51,200
and the presence of kedushah are
mutually exclusive, are two opposites,

716
01:02:51,200 --> 01:03:02,011
because kedushah resides in binyan, in
beautiful architecture, in orderliness,

717
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:09,018
in wholesomeness and in prosperity.

718
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:26,502
Desolation, debris, ruins, ashes
permeate all kinds of kedushah and

719
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:37,446
the exalted disappears under
the ruins and the debris.

720
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,883
Ashes covers up kedushah, 
and the kedushah vanishes.

721
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:48,424
This is one approach,
I mean, halachically.

722
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,963
Or, the reverse is true.

723
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,566
Or the reverse is true, is correct.

724
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:00,803
Kedushah tolerates churban.

725
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:07,510
And Hakadosh Baruch Hu can reside not
only in a beautiful Beis Hamikdash but on

726
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:14,550
the desolate mount of "Har Tzion
sh'shameim shu'alim hilchu bo." He

727
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,119
can reside on the desolate mount

728
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,825
where the foxes come up and
down -- walk up and down.

729
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:35,338
He can be covered with ashes and
debris and still reside in that

730
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:41,978
particular spot, which is frightening
as far as desolation is concerned.

731
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,648
It's a problem, a halachic problem.

732
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,954
Strange, this problem was picked up

733
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,856
in the Torah

734
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,159
in Bechukosai.

735
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,663
In the parshah which 
we just read last Shabbos.

736
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,202
There is a strange pasuk in Bechukosai.

737
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,737
"V'nasasi es

738
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,706
areichem chor ," and I'll

739
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:17,346
make your towns desolate, "va'hashimosi
es mikdasheichem," and I'll

740
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:22,051
make your sanctuaries or your

741
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,720
batei mikdash desolate,

742
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,059
"v'lo ari'ach b'rei'ach nichochachem.

743
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:36,899
Va'hashimosi ani es ha'aretz v'shamemu
aleha oyveichem ha'yoshvim bah."

744
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,602
And I will make your cities a waste,

745
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,839
and will bring your
sanctuaries into desolation.

746
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:49,078
And I will bring the land into
desolation, and your enemies

747
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:56,485
that will dwell thereof will be astonished.

748
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:05,094
But let us just select three words:
"va'hashimosi es mikdasheichem," and I'll

749
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:09,398
make your sanctuaries waste or desolate.

750
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,901
We just read it.

751
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:19,041
This phrase, "va'hashimosi es
mikdasheichem," lends itself

752
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,509
to a double interpretation.

753
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,547
Interpretation number one,

754
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:31,387
your sanctuaries will be in a
state of desolation, 

755
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:40,329
which -- and in consequence, 
the kedushah

756
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,797
will be terminated,

757
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:49,405
since waste and holiness,
desolation and exaltedness,

758
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,007
are mutually exclusive.

759
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:57,279
"Va'hashimosi es mikdasheichem," I'll
destroy physically your sanctuaries,

760
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:01,650
completely destroyed, just debris, ashes,

761
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,820
dumping places,

762
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:12,695
and by destroying the physical
sanctuaries, I'll destroy the idea

763
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:16,332
of kedushah which hovered over them.

764
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:24,273
There'll be no mikdasheichem anymore
because shimamon u'mikdash, as I

765
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,777
said before, are mutually exclusive.

766
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:39,321
"I shall make your mikdashim a waste."

767
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,361
Of course, this

768
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,263
is the negative interpretation.

769
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,099
This can be interpreted
in the positive as well.

770
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,334
"Va'hashimosi es mikdasheichem," 

771
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:59,742
how I'll destroy physically 
your batei mikdash,

772
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:07,650
even though, nevertheless, they'll remain
mikdasheichem, in spite of everything.

773
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:20,129
So, actually, there are two
p'shatim, two interpretations.

774
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:23,532
What's your opinion, the
right interpretation?

775
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,268
I don't mean the interpretation you like.

776
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:33,309
I mean, from the standpoint of Torah
Sh'be'al Peh, which one is right?

777
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:34,610
Huh?

778
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:35,644
Yeah, I

779
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,013
know that I have your endorsement.

780
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,583
You agree with it.

781
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:45,454
Yeah, I couldn't decide
between such -- between

782
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:50,526
the two interpretations
without quoting a Gemara.

783
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,929
The Gemara helps out sometimes.

784
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,000
The Gemara helps.

785
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,635
They are very helpful.

786
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,804
The Mishnah

787
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:06,575
in Megillah, I believe it's one
of the last Mishnayos in Megillah.

788
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:10,012
"Beis ha'knesses sh'charav,"
a beis ha'knesses which

789
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:18,287
was destroyed, was consumed by fire
or desecrated by our enemies, just

790
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,056
debris, a heap of debris and ruins.

791
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:30,232
So, all the laws pertaining to beis
ha'knesses applies not only to a

792
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:35,771
beis ha'knesset which is built but
to a beis ha'knesset which is in

793
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,841
desolation, in a state of waste.

794
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:44,847
"Sh'ne'emar," the Mishnah says,
"'Va'hashimosi es mikdasheichem'

795
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:51,487
af al pi sh'shomemin hemah," even
though they are they are desolate,

796
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:57,459
"bi'kedushasan hen omdin," the kedushah
has not disappeared, has not vanished.

797
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:00,496
Kedushah is not frightened by churban.

798
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:10,906
The Rambam, in Hilchos Beis
Ha'Bechirah, developed the idea

799
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:15,611
that kedushas ha'mikdash, which was

800
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:23,652
introduced by King Solomon, by Shlomo
Hamelech, continued throughout the

801
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:32,595
ages and the millennia to hover over
b'Yerushalayim in the Har Habayis 

802
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:38,300
and "kedushah rishona kidshah l'sha'atah v'kidshah l'asid lavo."

803
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,236
The first kedushah, meaning Shlomo's --

804
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,204
King Solomon's kedushah or 
David's kedushah --

805
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:47,042
we don't know exactly who consecrated the Beis Hamikdash, Shlomo or David.

806
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,811
We don't know, but it

807
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:49,612
doesn't matter as far as

808
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:50,946
we are concerned.

809
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:58,454
Throughout the millennia, since the
first kiddush, the kedushah prevailed,

810
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,256
regardless of the fact that

811
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:06,829
so many years, the Beis Hamikdash has

812
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,732
been in a state of desolation.

813
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:16,438
Physical desolation does not
cancel the category -- does not

814
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:21,844
eliminate kedushah and exaltedness.

815
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:36,925
The exaltedness of the place, why?

816
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,928
The Rambam asks himself, why?

817
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:44,199
Why do I say so?

818
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,934
Why does it -- 

819
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:50,739
as a matter of fact, with regard
to kedushas ha'aretz, to the holiness

820
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:54,276
of the land, to the sanctity of the
land, the Rambam is of the opinion that

821
01:11:54,276 --> 01:12:02,384
the kedushah which was introduced by
Yehoshua was discontinued at the time of

822
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:08,057
Nevuchadnetzar when his legions occupied
Eretz Yisrael, invaded Eretz Yisrael.

823
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:13,262
So why kedushat Shlomo was not
discontinued -- was continued throughout

824
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:18,200
the ages, and kedushas Yehoshua was
discontinued throughout the ages?

825
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,102
It was discontinued?

826
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:25,641
So, the Rambam answers -- I
mean, you all know the answer.

827
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:29,611
Kedushas ha'aretz in
the time of Yehoshua was

828
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:34,850
based upon power, upon military
victory, upon conquest.

829
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,955
Yehoshua was strong, he conquered
the land, he consecrated the

830
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:42,057
land and hallowed the land.

831
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:48,097
Nevuchadnetzar was stronger, he
conquered the land, he put an

832
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,832
end to the kedushas ha'aretz.

833
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:56,338
But the Beis Hamikdash, he says,
"eino ela mipnei haShechinah."

834
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,375
The fact that the Beis Hamikdash
is kovesh is not because somebody

835
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:04,079
conquered the Beis Hamikdash, because
of military conquest, but because the

836
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,350
Shechinah resides, abides
on that particular spot.

837
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:12,888
"U'Shechinah einah beteilah
l'olam," the Shechinah is never

838
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:19,962
-- can never be removed from that particular
spot, "v'harei hu omer 'Va'hashimosi es

839
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:26,368
mikdasheichem' v'amru Chachamim af al
pi sh'shomemin hen bi'kedushasan havei."

840
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:40,249
True, God abides in both, in
binyan as well as in churban.

841
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:44,720
Kedushah and churban are
not conflicting ideas.

842
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:52,327
God abides in splendor and in grandeur, in
the vast stretches of the universe -- of

843
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:58,200
course, "Ha'shamayim kis'i v'ha'aretz
hadom raglai" -- as well as in the

844
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,906
desolation, loneliness, bleakness on
the Har Habayis throughout the ages.

845
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:13,415
As a beautiful universe with
endless, uncharted lanes, and all

846
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,418
that is just the abode of God.

847
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:26,495
Why should He reside on a lonely
mountain or hill, which -- I mean, and be

848
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:33,268
covered with ashes and debris?

849
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:37,206
Why should God not move away from
that particular spot?

850
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:40,476
Apparently, God has a different approach.

851
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:48,283
He resides in the universe, "m'lo
kol ha'aretz kevodo." He resides

852
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:56,458
in a small place which is bleak and
dreary, and which for 1,900 years has

853
01:14:56,458 --> 01:15:02,364
stood alone, lonely, without hope.

854
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:10,172
God refused to leave this spot
on which His house once stood.

855
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:15,043
The sanctity of that spot 
continued throughout the ages.

856
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,449
So, the Mishnah and the Rambam --

857
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,317
 I mean, he quoted the Mishnah --

858
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,852
have decided 

859
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:27,022
that "Va'hashimosi es
mikdasheichem" should be interpreted

860
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:29,892
in the Torah into the positive.

861
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:33,562
It means, "af al pi sh'shomemin,"
even though they are desolate, there

862
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:41,003
is desolation, still, "bi'kedushasan
omdin," their kedushah continues.

863
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,641
Now let me ask you.

864
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:50,345
Why did the Chachamim 
interpret it like that?

865
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,583
Why did the Chachamim
interpret it like that?

866
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:00,989
Yes?

867
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,791
Why?

868
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,827
What prompted them to
interpret it like that?

869
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:09,431
"Va'hashimosi es mikdasheichem" means

870
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:20,142
I'll simply destroy your sanctuaries and
the idea of kedushah and the exaltedness

871
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,543
will vanish.

872
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:27,516
The land, Yerushalayim and the Har
Habayis will be just as holy as any

873
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,818
other spot, or just as profane 

874
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:32,487
as any other spot in the world, 
in the universe.

875
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:35,891
[Inaudible]

876
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,661
Yeah, but the question is correct, I know.

877
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:44,266
But, however, if the Mishnah in
Megillah said so and the Rambam

878
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:47,836
accepted it -- and the Rambam also
quoted the Mishnah in Megillah,

879
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:52,240
apparently there is a reason, and that
reason has got to be found in Chumash

880
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,210
-- not in Chumash exactly.

881
01:16:55,210 --> 01:17:00,849
I mean, in Torah Sh'biksav,
which prompted our scholars, our

882
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:06,488
rabbis to interpret "Va'hashimosi
es mikdasheichem" in a positive

883
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,324
sense, not in a negative sense.

884
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,159
What forced them?

885
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,828
[Inaudible]

886
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,530
Yes, yes, but

887
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,600
what about the Chumash?

888
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,669
Avraham Avinu.

889
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:21,770
[Inaudible]

890
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,572
It might be.

891
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,510
I believe

892
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,445
Huh?

893
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:31,146
[Inaudible]

894
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,648
What?

895
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,385
I don't know.

896
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,421
If Amos knows the answer,
I would have asked him.

897
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:54,336
No, there's got to be -- this answer
has got to be developed in basic terms,

898
01:17:55,637 --> 01:18:03,578
in our outlook upon the world, in our
perspective, in our world perspective.

899
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:10,619
I believe -- I mean, did you -- last
Shabbos, when you heard the Maftir

900
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:16,024
of Bechukosai, did you ask yourself
what is the link between the Maftir of

901
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,794
Bechukosai and the parshah of Bechukosai?

902
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,931
The same question which I
raised with regard to Amos,

903
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,300
[inaudible]

904
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,837
Acharei Mos-Kedoshim,
I raised the question, what has got

905
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:34,342
Amos -- what has got the Haftarah
of "Adoshem uzi u'ma'uzi" -- this

906
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:44,019
was the Haftarah last Shabbos -- got
to do with the parshah where the

907
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,255
tochachah is made -- was formulated?

908
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,192
What?

909
01:18:50,625 --> 01:19:01,770
If you ask me, three words in the
parshah, six words in Yirmiyahu.

910
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:09,678
If you have a Chumash Vayikra, open up
the Book of Vayikra, and choose -- and

911
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:14,182
cast a glance on the Haftarah.

912
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:20,188
There are six words, strange words,
but those six words have influenced

913
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:25,961
our Chazal, our rabbis, to interpret
"'Va'hashimosi es mikdashechem' af

914
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:32,901
al pi sh'shomemin hen bi'kedushasan
omdin" enthusiastically in terms

915
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:36,905
of our emunah in the future of
Eretz Yisrael and Yerushalayim.

916
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:37,873
What?

917
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,776
Six words.

918
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:47,315
And that's why this Haftarah was chosen,
this portion of the Prophet was chosen

919
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:53,321
-- Yirmiyahu was chosen to be the Haftarah
of Bechukosai, Behar and Bechukosai.

920
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:56,158
"V'shamatetah u'vecha mi'nachalasecha"?

921
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,359
What what what?

922
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,794
"V'shamatetah u'vecha mi'nachalasecha"?

923
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,895
Now you are guessing.

924
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,031
Correct.

925
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,400
There is a strange pasuk.

926
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,236
Correct, correct, it was said already.

927
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:13,642
Oh, I'll let you finish.

928
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,646
Yes, here we read a very strange sentence.

929
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:26,188
"Kisei kavod marom mei'rishon mekom
mikdasheinu. Mikveh Yisrael atah."

930
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:33,261
The throne of glory on high -- 

931
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:38,300
and it happens that the traditional
translation is pretty good here.

932
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:47,108
The throne of glory, on high from the
beginning, the place of our sanctuary.

933
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:50,345
The hope of Israel, O Lord.

934
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:51,947
What does it mean?

935
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:57,619
"Kisei kavod marom mei'rishon," the
kisei kavod which was established

936
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:03,859
from the very beginning, "mekom
mikdasheinu," the abode of our sanctuary.

937
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:08,163
"Mikveh Yisrael," you
are the hope of Israel.

938
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:18,840
What idea did the Navi express or
formulate in this short six-word sentence

939
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:24,246
which has played such great importance,
I mean, for the interpretation of

940
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:27,582
"Va'hashimosi es mikdashechem." What idea?

941
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:28,750
I mean, you have

942
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,886
you all know the idea.

943
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:39,728
I call this idea the double image theory.

944
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,564
The double image theory,

945
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:46,067
don’t get frightened, it’s not philosophy.

946
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,237
Double image theory.

947
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:55,911
The word double image theory, I
derived the term -- it's my term.

948
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,446
I haven't plagiarized anyone.

949
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:05,153
The double image theory, I derived
this term from a story in Chumash

950
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:09,791
which we all know, from the story
in Chumash about Jacob who stopped

951
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:15,230
over for the night in a certain
place, when he saw the ladder, you

952
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:23,204
know, I mean, standing on the ground
and reaching the skies, heavens.

953
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,239
"U'malachei

954
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:30,578
Elokim olim v'yordim bo," and the
angels of God were climbing up

955
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:35,116
and descending along this ladder.

956
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,218
So you are so the

957
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:42,257
Gemara in Chullin says,
"Olim lema'alah yordim

958
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,392
lematah," they go down to Jacob,

959
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:47,529
real Jacob, the physical Jacob, who

960
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,698
was sparkling with d'mus deyukno.

961
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:55,770
And they take a good look at his
face, at his countenance, his body.

962
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,006
Is he good-looking, or isn't he?

963
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:03,511
"V'olim lema'alah u'mistaklin 
b'd'mus deyukno,"

964
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,714
and they go up to heaven 
and they take

965
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:09,951
another look, but this time not at the
physical Jacob -- the physical Jacob

966
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:16,124
was sleeping -- at the Jacob whose
image was engraved in the Kisei Hakavod.

967
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:18,560
That's what Rashi says in Chullin.

968
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:28,603
So, in other words, each Jew has
two images, the image from lematah,

969
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:34,609
the physical image, and the image
of lema'alah, the image which is

970
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,644
engraved in the Kisei Hakavod.

971
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:39,581
And not only people have a double image.

972
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:43,151
Any institution in Yahadus
has a double image.

973
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,620
Shabbos.

974
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,522
It's a day of rest.

975
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:51,226
So, the Midrash tells us -- excuse me,
Rabbi Lamm came and mentioned the Zohar,

976
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:53,628
so I have to mention it, too, now.

977
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:55,897
The Zohar, I

978
01:23:55,897 --> 01:24:00,168
believe, in the hakdamah of Vayakhel -- I
don't remember exactly -- it says,

979
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:05,140
"V'shabbsosai tishmoru." So, "Ha'hu
Taya," the Bedouin who met Rabbi

980
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:10,311
Shimon bar Yochai -- the Bedouin,
the famous Bedouin, Taya, who was

981
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:13,048
acquainted with kol ha'Torah kulah.

982
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:17,485
This Bedouin met Rabbi Shimon bar
Yochai and asked him why is the Shabbos

983
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:23,358
mentioned in the plural, not in the
singular, "Shabbsosai tishmoru." So,

984
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,427
Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai didn't know.

985
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:30,698
So, the Bedouin began to
deliver a shiur about it.

986
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:37,672
And finally, the consequence of
that treatise which the Bedouins

987
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:41,076
developed the idea that Shabbos

988
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,777
has two images, too.

989
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:51,152
One image, Shabbos mi'l'tatah and Shabbos
l'ilaah, two images, two different images.

990
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:57,525
Whoever, and I believe there are many
Chassidim here, even though lately they

991
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:02,430
stopped saying K'gavna, in fact, but
there are some here who say K'gavna.

992
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:08,403
The whole idea of the double
image of Shabbos is actually,

993
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,238
I mean, expressed in K'gavna.

994
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:13,741
Next time, Friday night, you'll pay
attention to what you are saying.

995
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,579
[Break in audio]

996
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,719
And basically, it's not Isaiah.

997
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,555
It's more than Isaiah.

998
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:33,828
It's a Mishnah in Ta’anit, that
the Levi'im used to say shirah.

999
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:38,733
Every day, they had a separate -- a
different psalm, a different shirah.

1000
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:46,975
On Shabbos, "Hayu omrim 'Mizmor
shir l'yom ha'Shabbos'… lavo l'yom

1001
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:52,947
sh'kulo Shabbos menuchah l'chayei
ha'olamim." And I heard once from

1002
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:56,251
my father, zichron livrachah, in
the name of Reb Chaim that the

1003
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:58,319
Nevi'im used to say so actually.

1004
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,724
They used to say on Shabbos, "Mizmor
shir l'yom ha'Shabbos," the beginning

1005
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:07,662
of the psalm and then they used
to conclude, "Mizmor shir l'yom

1006
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:12,033
ha'Shabbos l'yom sh'kulo Shabbos
u'menuchah l'chayei ha'olamim."

1007
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:15,670
Again, there are two
Shabbatot, two Shabbosim.

1008
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,940
We have the Shabbos l'satah.

1009
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,308
We say day and the week.

1010
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:26,247
On the week, a Jew has to abstain
from work and have a different -- and

1011
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:32,620
adopt a different lifestyle, but it
is just -- it's an ordinary Shabbos.

1012
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,355
It's a day on which you don't work.

1013
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,490
That's all.

1014
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:39,961
And the day on which you study
Torah, correct, because the Shabbos

1015
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:41,763
is consecrated in study on Shabbat.

1016
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,498
but that’s all.

1017
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:47,569
Well, there's a Shabbos
l'eilah, a Shabbos above.

1018
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,705
Shabbos l'eilah

1019
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:57,645
is l'yom sh'kulo Shabbos, a day
which is -- whose entirety and

1020
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:07,822
very essence is Shabbos, sh'kulo
Shabbos and expresses itself in

1021
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:11,693
a variety of ways, in particular,
in menuchah l'chayei ha'olamim.

1022
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:16,998
So, basically, it's a Mishnah, even
though I may call your attention.

1023
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,969
Rashi in Rosh Hashanah differs with
Reb Chaim in the p'shat, "L'yom sh'kulo

1024
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:24,606
Shabbos umenuchah l'chayei ha'olamim."
So, if you look up the Rashi in

1025
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:30,712
Rosh Hashanah, they ruled, beis din,
so you'll find that I was wrong.

1026
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:35,984
But anyway, in Shabbos, we
have the two ideas of Shabbos

1027
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,151
l'satah, of Shabbos l'eilah.

1028
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:45,460
We know very well that as far as Beis
Hamikdash and Yerushalayim are concerned,

1029
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,929
there is certainly a double image theory.

1030
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:53,434
Who doesn't know of Yerushalayim shel
matah and Yerushalayim shel ma'alah?

1031
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,336
Even Zionists know about it.

1032
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:02,110
Who doesn't know of Beis Hamikdash shel
ma'alah and Beis Hamikdash shel matah?

1033
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,778
It's mentioned in Az Yashir.

1034
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:09,183
"Mikdash Adoshem konenu
yadecha. Adoshem yimloch l'olam va'ed."

1035
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:12,253
Where is

1036
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:17,558
all that mentioned in
Yirmiyahu, in our Haftarah?

1037
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:19,127
Kisei kavod.

1038
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:24,032
The Kisei Hakavod, the throne of glory.

1039
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:28,236
Marom mei'rishon, on the very
beginning, even before the beginning.

1040
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:35,310
Is mekom mikdasheinu, when a Jew speaks
about the Beis Hamikdash, he has in mind

1041
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:43,284
not the brick and the mortar and the
sand and the gold in the Beis Hamikdash.

1042
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:46,387
This is not the Beis Hamikdash,
ha'Beis Hamikdash shel lematah.

1043
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:48,389
But there is another Beis Hamikdash.

1044
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:53,594
 "Kisei kavod marom mei'rishon" which is "mekom mikdasheinu."

1045
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:56,364
There is a Beis Hamikdash 
shel ma'alah 

1046
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:03,204
and that is why mikveh Yisrael.

1047
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:06,074
We have hope in the Almighty.

1048
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:15,149
That is the reason why "Va'hashimosi
ani es mikdasheichem" was interpreted in

1049
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:20,221
positive terms, not in negative terms.

1050
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:23,191
Why is it "af al pi sh'shomemin
bi'kedushasan omdin"?

1051
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:28,229
Yeah, the enemy could have destroyed and did destroy everything,

1052
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:33,201
but not the Beis Hamikdash shel ma'alah, d'marom mei'rishon mekom mikdasheinu.

1053
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:37,939
 And as long as the mekom 
mikdasheinu exists,

1054
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:43,811
so the Shechinah resides not only lema'alah but lematah as well.

1055
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:48,816
And if the Shechinah resides, 
is mikveh Yisrael.

1056
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:52,653
So we have hope that everything
will be restored.

1057
01:29:53,654 --> 01:30:00,995
And the people will return, and that
neither the land will forget her children,

1058
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:03,398
nor will the children forget their mother.

1059
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:10,071
This pasuk, "Kisei kavod marom mei'rishon
mekom mikdasheinu. Mikveh Yisrael."

1060
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:17,111
And it's very strange, that the tochachah,
where it speaks of "Va'hashimosi es

1061
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:24,419
mikdasheichem" is accompanied by the
nevu'ah of Yirmiyahu, who was the

1062
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:28,389
prophet of churban, of desolation, but

1063
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:31,659
still, he told the people, don't worry.

1064
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:33,761
There will be churban, 
there will be desolation.

1065
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:39,567
Many things will be destroyed,
but not the mekom mikdasheinu.

1066
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:44,605
And as long as the mekom mikdasheinu
is marom mei'rishon, the mikveh

1067
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,741
Yisrael will not disappoint you.

1068
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:54,081
And that's why the
Haftarah of Bechukosai was chosen.

1069
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:59,587
This chapter in Jeremiah was chosen
as the Haftarah of Bechukosai.

1070
01:30:59,587 --> 01:31:04,125
Because without the chapter of
Jeremiah, without this six-word

1071
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:08,463
sentence, I would have said that
"Va'hashimosi es mikdasheichem"

1072
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:11,933
should be interpreted in the negative.

1073
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:16,704
I'll destroy not only the physical
structure but the kedushah as well.

1074
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:22,310
What saved the "Va'hashimosi es
mikdasheichem" is this six-word

1075
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,848
sentence: "Kisei kavod marom
mei'rishon mekom mikdasheinu."

1076
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:36,290
So, it's very strange now.

1077
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,759
Acharei Mos and Kedoshim

1078
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:40,828
started with what?

1079
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:42,330
With the problem of galus.

1080
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:51,339
Amos, we already recited Amos, who
tells the people -- what does he

1081
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:55,676
actually -- the synopsis of Amos' message?

1082
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:58,346
Don't be frightened.

1083
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:03,150
You'll lose -- you might lose Eretz
Yisrael for a while, a short while or

1084
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:09,257
sometimes for a long time, but the final
destiny of the people of Israel, of the

1085
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:11,893
Knesset Yisrael, will be fully realized.

1086
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:18,266
You will come back and then
the land will be yours forever.

1087
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:26,040
And we asked, we are not
satisfied with Amos' answer.

1088
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,644
We ask, I mean, where is the guarantee?

1089
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:32,914
Who is the orev, so to say?

1090
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:34,949
Who endorses the promise?

1091
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:38,419
So, when we come

1092
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,625
from Acharei Mos-Kedoshim to
Behar and Bechukosai, 

1093
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,628
where is the endorsement in that?

1094
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:57,572
In Behar, the story about Yirmiyahu,
who bought real estate, purchased the

1095
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:02,977
field from his uncle on the day on which
Yerushalayim, 

1096
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:10,217
was attacked by Nevuchadnetzar.

1097
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:12,620
And God gave him to -- 

1098
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:18,526
I mean, and he gave his
uncle -- his uncle gave him two documents,

1099
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:24,932
two deeds, the chasum and the galuy,
the mysterious deed and the plain deed.

1100
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:32,106
And the Navi said, "od yikanu batim
v'sados u'keramim b'harei Yerushalayim."

1101
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:39,747
And particularly, what was important
is the sentence, "Kisei kavod

1102
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:44,885
marom mei'rishon 

1103
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:47,788
mekom mikdasheinu.

1104
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:51,392
Mikveh Yisrael Adoshem." This

1105
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:57,665
is actually the guarantees in the
double image theory of the mikdash

1106
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:59,133
lematah and mikdash lema'alah.

1107
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:00,501
That's it.

1108
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:10,077
So, is Acharei Mos and Kedoshim -- I
mean, state the fact that Yisrael

1109
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:18,953
will come back to Eretz Yisrael from
captivity, explains, I mean, the reasons

1110
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:24,558
why we believe so, so strongly believe

1111
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:29,263
in the return of the children to Eretz
Yisrael is because of this six-word

1112
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:36,337
sentence, "Kisei kavod marom mei'rishon
mekom mikdasheinu. Mikveh Yisrael."

1113
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,004
That means

1114
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:42,543
the one unit, Acharei Mos and Kedoshim
and Behar and Bechukosai is one unit.

1115
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:46,947
There is fright of galus, 
there is consolation,

1116
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:53,487
and then Jeremiah explains
to us what is the reason.

1117
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:56,924
I mean, what guarantee do we
have that the Beis Hamikdash in

1118
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,559
Eretz Yisrael will be restored?

1119
01:34:58,559 --> 01:35:02,196
And the guarantee is mekom
mikdasheinu, "Kisei kavod marom

1120
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:04,765
mei'rishon mekom mikdasheinu."

1121
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:07,735
Now,

1122
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:09,370
next.

1123
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,240
There is

1124
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:20,781
another haftarah in Parshas Vayikra.

1125
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,518
I mean in the Sefer Vayikra.

1126
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:31,892
And which is accompanied
as usual by a haftarah.

1127
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:38,132
And the question as far as this
haftarah is concerned is not so

1128
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:40,101
much about the common denominator.

1129
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:45,239
As a matter of fact, not only do
they have a common motif, 

1130
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,842
they are almost identical.

1131
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:51,846
The parsha and haftarah
are almost identical.

1132
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,716
And I would like to

1133
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:10,397
gain a few insights into the
haftarah because there is a problem.

1134
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:13,067
So, what is new about it?

1135
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:16,036
I mean, the navi repeats exactly what

1136
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:17,838
the Torah said.

1137
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,308
Which haftarah you have in mind?

1138
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:23,577
Which one?

1139
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:26,347
I don't hear.

1140
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:28,382
Emor, correct.

1141
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:34,855
Emor, if you open up your Chumash
and you study the haftarah of Emor,

1142
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:40,294
it's a repetition, almost verbatim
repetition of the Torah shebichtav.

1143
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:45,432
And so the question now is reversed.

1144
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:50,838
Why was it chosen?

1145
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:53,874
Another haftarah should have been chosen.

1146
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,709
But here is simply repetition.

1147
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:59,547
Of course, this problem
is not doesn't bother me.

1148
01:36:59,947 --> 01:37:08,255
But I believe that I would
like to explain to you the haftarah of

1149
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:17,431
Emor, what did this haftarah do with
regard to our final hope of geulas Yisrael.

1150
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:21,068
The haftarah of Parshas Emor

1151
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,410
is almost repetition of
the text of the Torah.

1152
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:36,350
However, a thorough analysis will
yield interesting conclusions.

1153
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:38,986
First,

1154
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:45,793
let me ask you a simple question.

1155
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:56,203
The book of Vayikra, particularly
the Parshas Emor, deals almost

1156
01:37:56,203 --> 01:38:01,141
exclusively with the laws
pertaining to kohanim, kehuna.

1157
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:05,346
It is called Toras Kohanim.

1158
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:09,650
So Yechezkel

1159
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:17,324
in his prophecies, quite a number of
prophecies, repeats the laws of kehuna.

1160
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:27,902
I mean, those laws with regard to which
the kohen has a different is commanded.

1161
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:36,410
Those laws which the kohen is commanded to
fulfill in contrast with a Yisrael who is

1162
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:40,281
not duty bound to comply with those laws.

1163
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:42,783
I don't have to tell
you what I have in mind.

1164
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,151
Now,

1165
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:55,229
but if you start reading the
haftarah of Yechezkel, will

1166
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:56,931
somebody read the pasuk in Yechezkel?

1167
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:02,937
Yes, just read a pasuk from Yechezkel.

1168
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,706
Alright, it is [inaudible].

1169
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:17,251
Vehakohanim haLeviim bnei Tzadok
asher shamru mishmeres mikdashi bisos

1170
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:23,157
bnei Yisrael me'alai, heimah yikrevu
elai lesharteni, heimah yavo'u el

1171
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:29,296
mikdashi, veheimah yakrivu al shulchani
lesharteni, veshamru es mishmeres.

1172
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:31,765
When you hear the pasuk, and if

1173
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:33,600
you open a Chumash and

1174
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:39,640
read it carefully, there is one
difference between Emor and, and I'm

1175
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,711
not speaking about the differences which
Chazal already, I mean, dealt with,

1176
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:46,580
vealmanah asher tihyeh 
almana lekohein yikachu,

1177
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:48,949
This is Chazal already, 
I mean, they dealt with

1178
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:50,517
this problem.

1179
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:53,153
But I, I'm dealing with something else.

1180
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:00,160
The book of Vayikra the sedra of

1181
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:09,570
Emor is a code of laws, is a code
where the laws pertaining, the special

1182
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:14,174
laws pertaining to the kohen were
formulated by the Torah, correct?

1183
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:18,912
In particular the laws which are

1184
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:26,587
related to the kohen personally not
him as far as the kohen is meaning as

1185
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:31,558
far as the ministrations of
the kohen unto the Almighty.

1186
01:40:31,558 --> 01:40:36,263
But as far as the person of the kohen
is concerned, ve'isha zona vachalala

1187
01:40:36,263 --> 01:40:40,167
lo yikachu, ve'isha gerusha me'isha
lo yikachu and so forth, al kol

1188
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:41,435
nafshos meis lo yavo,

1189
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:43,470
all right.

1190
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:46,306
This is in Emor.

1191
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:53,147
The pasuk in the haftarah
starts with what?

1192
01:40:53,147 --> 01:41:01,855
Vehakohanim haLeviim bnei Tzadok asher
shamru mishmeres mikdashi bisos bnei

1193
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:08,729
Yisrael me'alai, heimah yikrevu elai
lesharteni, heimah yavo'u el mikdashi.

1194
01:41:09,129 --> 01:41:13,467
And whoever studies Yechezkel carefully,
in the previous chapters, Yechezkel

1195
01:41:13,467 --> 01:41:17,838
tells us the following story: that
many kohanim have betrayed the kehuna.

1196
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:20,774
And they walked away from the kehuna.

1197
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:24,478
Many became defiled with avodah zarah.

1198
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:30,150
Many because they intermarried or they
married women who were not qualified

1199
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:33,554
to marry a kohen, and so forth.

1200
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:40,828
But there was a Bnei Tzadok, a family
of kohanim called Bnei Tzadok, who were

1201
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:47,000
committed, totally committed to the law,
to the Torah, and to Hakadosh Baruch Hu.

1202
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,006
And when all people, all the people,
bisos Bnei Yisrael went astray,

1203
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:57,878
bitos Bnei Yisrael, they remained
steadfast in their commitment, and

1204
01:41:57,878 --> 01:42:02,583
they continued to live like kohanim
the way the Torah has required of them.

1205
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:06,653
Bisos Bnei Yisrael hakohanim

1206
01:42:06,653 --> 01:42:14,595
haLeviim bnei Tzadok asher shamru
mishmeres mikdashi, which I mean not so

1207
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:18,265
much guarding the Beis Hamikdash, there
was no Beis Hamikdash to be guarded,

1208
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:24,872
for 70 years of churban, there wasn't.

1209
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:28,642
Asher shamru es mikdashi means they
they lived in accordance with the law.

1210
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:32,045
Bitos Bnei Yisrael me'alai, at

1211
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:38,152
a time when the the people of
Israel, many, the majority, separated

1212
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:42,956
themselves from Me and they went astray.

1213
01:42:45,025 --> 01:42:46,693
What Yechezkel is saying

1214
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:49,997
is something very important.

1215
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:56,503
Emor contains the laws of kehuna,
the law of kehuna, the law.

1216
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:03,977
Yechezkel in the haftarah,
in the haftarah to Emor,

1217
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:09,049
is speaking about kehuna
as a promise, that kehuna

1218
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:10,250
will not disappear.

1219
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:16,423
That kehuna will exist, will continue

1220
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:19,760
forever.

1221
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,165
Because I want you to know, a kohen
is not, kehuna is not just a matter of

1222
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:29,403
nesias kapayim or of being called up.

1223
01:43:29,403 --> 01:43:32,673
When we speak about kehuna, we don't
have in mind only nesias kapayim.

1224
01:43:32,673 --> 01:43:35,576
Nesias kapayim is a mitzvah, correct.

1225
01:43:35,576 --> 01:43:38,245
But there is something
more than nesias kapayim.

1226
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:40,914
There is something more
than being called up,

1227
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:45,285
I mean, to the sefer Torah.

1228
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,456
Kehuna is a part of kedushas Yisrael.

1229
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:53,894
Am Yisrael, the
people of Israel, I mean,

1230
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:57,297
the nation, is ama
tlisai, the Gemara says.

1231
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:03,170
Is a three-structured
or threefold community.

1232
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:08,775
Ama tlisai, a threefold nation.

1233
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:11,745
It is Kohen, Levi, Yisrael.

1234
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:15,215
And this is a part of the kedusha, of kedushas Yisrael.

1235
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:19,987
That within kedushas Yisrael, we have three degrees of kedusha.

1236
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:23,490
Kedushas kehuna, kedushas
Levi, and kedushas Yisrael.

1237
01:44:26,059 --> 01:44:27,694
And,

1238
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,932
if there is an institution

1239
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:40,140
which is exposed to
defilement and to disintegration,

1240
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,542
this is the institution of kehuna.

1241
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:49,950
Already when Ezra came back from from
Bavel, so you read in Ezra and Nechemiah

1242
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:55,756
about Ezra's struggles, efforts,
to restore the old kehuna, because

1243
01:44:55,756 --> 01:45:02,663
the people in Bavel intermarried,
intermarried into Gentile families.

1244
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:04,197
They intermarried as

1245
01:45:04,197 --> 01:45:06,500
far as pesulei kehuna are concerned.

1246
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:14,241
There were the children, and of course,
intermarriage whether the secular Jews

1247
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:19,079
like it or dislike it, a intermarriage
affects the status of the child.

1248
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:22,115
Some children are goyim goyim.

1249
01:45:22,115 --> 01:45:24,484
Some children are mamzerim.

1250
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:28,288
Some children are chalalim.

1251
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:31,425
I mean, you can't help it, you
can't help it, this is the law.

1252
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:36,630
But of course, I mean, after they
had been exiled from Eretz Yisrael

1253
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:44,471
and they had they lost control over
marriages and kehuna u'leviya and

1254
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:48,075
ordinary kedushas Yisrael in Bavel,

1255
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:55,916
so they actually, I mean, lost
control over kedushas Yisrael.

1256
01:45:55,916 --> 01:46:01,755
And many kohanim were put
aside and they were told they

1257
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:06,159
cannot minister unto the Almighty
in the Beis Hamikdash, nor were

1258
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,328
they permitted to eat terumah.

1259
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:14,301
And you read in Ezra Nechemiah,
ad amod kohen leUrim velaTumim.

1260
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:18,038
Those people cannot be identified
as kohanim, they'll have to wait

1261
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:21,908
for the Melech Hamashiach to
give them the identity of kehuna.

1262
01:46:23,276 --> 01:46:27,180
And kehuna is a very fragile
institution, very fragile.

1263
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:32,919
Particularly, I discovered it, I
discovered it in the United States.

1264
01:46:32,919 --> 01:46:38,792
When I became a Rav in the United
States, and in Boston, the first

1265
01:46:38,792 --> 01:46:42,329
wedding I performed, so the
chosson was all dressed up with a

1266
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:44,598
beautiful carnation on his lapel.

1267
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,768
A nice boy,

1268
01:46:47,768 --> 01:46:50,170
made an impression of a nice boy.

1269
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:55,942
So then I began to fill in the
kesubah, I said, you have to identify

1270
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:58,845
yourself, Kohen, Levi, or Yisrael.

1271
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:03,617
So I met with a quizzical
look, with astonishment.

1272
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:05,752
He didn't understand
what I was talking about.

1273
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:08,221
So I was astonished.

1274
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:11,625
But I recovered from my astonishment.

1275
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:14,194
You know why?

1276
01:47:14,194 --> 01:47:18,899
Because the majority of the Jews
in America, majority, the vast majority,

1277
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:20,734
doesn't know what what kehuna is.

1278
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:23,837
Absolutely does not know what kehuna is.

1279
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:27,607
Meet a Jew on the street,
or a student on a campus.

1280
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:30,510
I don't mean those baalei teshuvah.

1281
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,279
I'm not speaking about baalei teshuvah.

1282
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:35,081
I'm speaking about the average
Jew in the United States.

1283
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:36,516
I mean the youth on the campus.

1284
01:47:36,516 --> 01:47:38,952
Ask them whether they are Kohen, Levi,

1285
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:40,387
Yisrael, and they wouldn't understand you.

1286
01:47:40,387 --> 01:47:42,422
Not only they wouldn't have an
answer, they wouldn't understand

1287
01:47:42,422 --> 01:47:44,591
what you are talking to him.

1288
01:47:45,859 --> 01:47:50,764
And that's why I always tell the
people, ketanim ugedolim, whether

1289
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:55,035
they reached maturity or they didn't
reach maturity, to go up to duchan.

1290
01:47:56,102 --> 01:47:57,871
All children go up to duchan.

1291
01:47:57,871 --> 01:48:01,875
It's no time now to play around with
Rashi versus Tosfos whether there is

1292
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:04,444
chinuch on kehuna on birkas kapayim.

1293
01:48:04,444 --> 01:48:09,282
Because the whole institution
of kehuna is actually about

1294
01:48:09,282 --> 01:48:11,251
to disintegrate and collapse.

1295
01:48:16,289 --> 01:48:18,725
There is a terrible problem.

1296
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:31,872
So, in Emor, in Emor, there is no promise
by God that kehuna will exist forever.

1297
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,842
The laws of kehuna were formulated.

1298
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:40,347
But Hakadosh Baruch Hu, Moshe, did not
disclose to the people whether kehuna

1299
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:47,320
is going to exist, to continue, or the
people or the Jews will defile the kehuna

1300
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,022
the way they have defiled many things.

1301
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:52,559
There is a law of kehuna.

1302
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:56,897
Emor is a parsha which
deals with the laws of kehuna.

1303
01:48:57,397 --> 01:49:00,767
It's not a parsha of the
promise that kehuna will exist.

1304
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:04,437
This was Yechezkel's job.

1305
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:12,746
Yechezkel said, before I discuss
the laws of kehuna, what a kohen

1306
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:13,980
is supposed to do, what he's not

1307
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,583
supposed to do, let me say one thing.

1308
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,251
Let me say one thing.

1309
01:49:18,251 --> 01:49:21,121
Kehuna will exist forever.

1310
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:29,629
I understand the menace to kehuna.

1311
01:49:29,629 --> 01:49:33,366
I understand the difficulties
which we will meet.

1312
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:38,371
I understand, I understand that it

1313
01:49:38,371 --> 01:49:43,510
will be very hard and tough on our
part to preserve the purity of

1314
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:46,513
kehuna, but it will be preserved.

1315
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:51,284
Before Yechezkel

1316
01:49:51,284 --> 01:49:55,689
began to tell the people the laws
of kehuna, he says: Vehakohanim

1317
01:49:55,689 --> 01:50:01,328
haLeviim bnei Tzadok, a small group
of kohanim the Bnei Kohanim are,

1318
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:04,030
their ancestor was Bnei Tzadok.

1319
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:08,268
But this group distinguished
itself mainly by what?

1320
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:19,179
By its steadfast loyalty and complete
total dedication to the laws of kehuna.

1321
01:50:19,179 --> 01:50:23,850
That they served God at a time at
which the people, the majority of

1322
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:29,389
the people lost completely, lost the
understanding for kedushas kehuna.

1323
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:36,429
bitos Bnei Yisrael me'alai, heimah yikrevu
elai lesharteni, veheimah yavo'u el

1324
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:44,471
mikdashi, veheimah yakrivu al shulchani,
veshamru es mishmeres avoseihem.

1325
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:50,310
And believe me that we need
such a promise nowadays as well.

1326
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,246
But I believe that Yechezkel's
promise is good for

1327
01:50:53,246 --> 01:50:55,281
our times too.

1328
01:50:57,283 --> 01:51:01,788
Because chas veshalom if kehuna
should be forgotten, then one

1329
01:51:01,788 --> 01:51:04,591
important aspect of kedushas Yisrael

1330
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:06,826
will drop out,

1331
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:11,898
will disappear, will vanish.

1332
01:51:28,448 --> 01:51:31,017
Now, 

1333
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:43,530
there's another aspect.

1334
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:46,199
There is another aspect which

1335
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:51,871
Yechezkel has developed with regard to
kehuna, which the Torah mentions it,

1336
01:51:52,138 --> 01:51:55,275
but not in Emor, but in V'zos Habracha.

1337
01:51:56,810 --> 01:52:01,448
But apparently Chazal when
they introduced the haftarah of

1338
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:11,191
Yechezkel, wanted the people to know
immediately what is required of them.

1339
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:13,927
I'll ask a simple question.

1340
01:52:13,927 --> 01:52:15,261
Aspect number two.

1341
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:20,433
Number one, Yechezkel introduced
the promise, not only law of kehuna,

1342
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:25,438
but the promise of kehuna, that
kehuna is a permanent institution.

1343
01:52:26,206 --> 01:52:29,976
Next, what did Yechezkel
introduce that we found it

1344
01:52:29,976 --> 01:52:37,217
important that the prophecy of Yechezkel
became the the haftarah of Emor?

1345
01:52:37,984 --> 01:52:42,021
He actually redefined the task of kehuna.

1346
01:52:42,021 --> 01:52:43,089
He redefined it.

1347
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:44,758
He reformulated it.

1348
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:52,232
Now let me ask you, what is the sense,
what is the source of kedushas kehuna?

1349
01:52:52,866 --> 01:52:57,003
Why are the kohanim superior
as far as kedusha is concerned

1350
01:52:57,203 --> 01:52:59,472
to the Leviim and Yisraelim?

1351
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:03,543
What is the source of kedushas kehuna?

1352
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:13,286
To what task is the kohen, should
a kohen be totally committed?

1353
01:53:16,422 --> 01:53:21,227
And what actually aspect he

1354
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:25,265
should unreservedly dedicate,
to dedicate himself?

1355
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:28,601
What would you answer?

1356
01:53:28,601 --> 01:53:31,371
What is the source of kedushas kehuna?

1357
01:53:35,008 --> 01:53:41,714
In what respect does the he possess superiority over the ordinary Jew?

1358
01:53:41,948 --> 01:53:43,483
Of course,

1359
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:51,090
the answer is his ministering, his participating in the avodah,

1360
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:54,694
in the service of God, 
or ministering unto God.

1361
01:53:54,694 --> 01:53:57,397
Is the origin of his specific image

1362
01:53:59,999 --> 01:54:03,403
his superior status in the community.

1363
01:54:03,403 --> 01:54:08,174
And the pasuk says in Emor, ki
lechem Elokav hu makri vehaya kodesh.

1364
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:16,216
Because the bread of God they do offer,
and therefore they shall be holy.

1365
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:24,924
The holiness of the kohen is a
result of his steady engagement in

1366
01:54:24,924 --> 01:54:28,228
worship, in the cultic service of God.

1367
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:36,970
It is the dedication to avodah and
korbanos that generates the kedusha.

1368
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:44,944
I have one question which should be answered.

1369
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:50,383
Kohanim,

1370
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:55,121
you take all the kohanim, I don't know
how many, I mean you have in Shmuel,

1371
01:54:55,121 --> 01:54:59,325
I know in Shmuel, Divrei HaYamim,
you have have numbers as far as

1372
01:54:59,325 --> 01:55:04,864
the kohanim are concerned, a
report about about the statistics.

1373
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:06,666
But

1374
01:55:08,668 --> 01:55:16,643
we know, we know that the kohanim were
divided into how many ... mishmaros?

1375
01:55:16,643 --> 01:55:20,647
24, 24 mishmaros, divisions.

1376
01:55:21,848 --> 01:55:28,922
See, if you have divided the kehuna in
24 mishmaros, it means that each kohen

1377
01:55:29,889 --> 01:55:32,592
could do avodah only two weeks a year.

1378
01:55:33,626 --> 01:55:34,894
Two weeks a year.

1379
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:38,798
Because once in every 24 weeks.

1380
01:55:39,365 --> 01:55:40,767
All right?

1381
01:55:41,067 --> 01:55:46,039
There are few months ...but anyway
it is about two weeks every year.

1382
01:55:50,176 --> 01:55:57,784
Moreover, the mishmar was divided
into subdivisions, botei av.

1383
01:55:58,151 --> 01:56:01,521
Each beit av served two days a year.

1384
01:56:02,322 --> 01:56:06,759
In other words, a kohen used
to serve only two days a year.

1385
01:56:08,194 --> 01:56:09,395
That's all.

1386
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:15,868
So let now let me ask, what did
the kohen do the rest of the year?

1387
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:24,510
What did he do the rest of the year?

1388
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:28,314
So you will say nothing?

1389
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:33,820
So the answer is, so why do I
have to give him matnos kehuna?

1390
01:56:36,789 --> 01:56:41,928
The whole idea, the whole system of
matnos kehuna is based upon the fact

1391
01:56:41,928 --> 01:56:45,965
that the kohanim were preoccupied
with the service in the Beis

1392
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:51,037
Hamikdash, and therefore could not
earn a living by their own efforts.

1393
01:56:52,071 --> 01:56:53,473
But I mean,

1394
01:56:55,742 --> 01:56:57,410
but it's not

1395
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:01,481
in accordance with the
statistics we just mentioned.

1396
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,818
The question was asked by whom?

1397
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:07,186
This question.

1398
01:57:08,221 --> 01:57:09,689
It's not a new one.

1399
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:11,357
Who asked this question?

1400
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:14,394
I mean somebody did ask this question.

1401
01:57:15,561 --> 01:57:17,330
It's too obvious.

1402
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,400
Moshe Rabbeinu.

1403
01:57:24,637 --> 01:57:26,773
Where did he ask this question?

1404
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:29,275
In V'zos Habracha.

1405
01:57:29,275 --> 01:57:33,246
In his last testament, he addressed
to the people on the day of his

1406
01:57:33,246 --> 01:57:36,182
death, of his departure from us.

1407
01:57:36,182 --> 01:57:40,753
So he redefined kehuna,
the task of kohanim.

1408
01:57:40,753 --> 01:57:48,628
He says, U'leLevi amar, yoru mishpatecha
leYaakov vesorascha leYisrael.

1409
01:57:48,628 --> 01:57:50,263
The task of the kohen is

1410
01:57:50,263 --> 01:57:51,798
to teach.

1411
01:57:52,865 --> 01:57:54,133
Not to minister.

1412
01:57:54,133 --> 01:57:55,835
Minister is a secondary task.

1413
01:57:57,036 --> 01:58:01,808
Teaching is the main job in which
in which a kohen must be engaged.

1414
01:58:01,808 --> 01:58:03,242
Teaching.

1415
01:58:04,477 --> 01:58:06,479
Yoru mishpatecha leYaakov, they

1416
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:13,252
should instruct your laws, instruct the
Yaakov in your laws, veSorascha leYisrael.

1417
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:18,324
In addition to that, they have
another cultic job, namely,

1418
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:20,827
to minister unto the Lord.

1419
01:58:20,827 --> 01:58:24,964
Yasimu k'torah be'apecha
vechalil al mizbechecha.

1420
01:58:24,964 --> 01:58:28,201
But this is the second task.

1421
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:33,673
The first task is yoru mishpatecha
leYaakov veSorascha leYisrael.

1422
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:44,484
The kedusha of kehuna consists

1423
01:58:44,484 --> 01:58:46,185
in teaching the people.

1424
01:58:46,486 --> 01:58:53,259
Not in ministering, not
exclusively ministering to the

1425
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:56,929
Lord, to God, but in teaching the people.

1426
01:58:58,731 --> 01:59:08,040
And the kedushas kehuna consists in a
kedusha of mesorah, of Torah Sheba'al Peh.

1427
01:59:08,474 --> 01:59:09,542
They taught the people.

1428
01:59:09,542 --> 01:59:12,211
They were the rashei yeshivos,
they were melamdim, they were the

1429
01:59:12,211 --> 01:59:14,380
instructors, they were the teachers.

1430
01:59:15,882 --> 01:59:19,819
As a matter of fact, a kohen who does
not teach, who does not teach the

1431
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:22,321
people, his kedusha is incomplete.

1432
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:30,163
A Yisrael who teaches the people, he
is engaged in the proper propagation

1433
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:34,167
of God's word, he is engaged in that.

1434
01:59:34,734 --> 01:59:38,671
This Yisrael has the status of a kohen.

1435
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:40,339
There is some kedusha. 

1436
01:59:41,307 --> 01:59:46,212
And perhaps the main source of
kedusha, kedushas kehuna, which

1437
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:49,282
is actually

1438
01:59:51,384 --> 01:59:56,556
of an educational character,
namely, the act of teaching.

1439
01:59:58,891 --> 02:00:00,793
Did Yechezkel say it?

1440
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:03,296
Did Yechezkel say it?

1441
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:09,368
Ve'es ami yoru, u'vein
tamei letahor yodium.

1442
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:10,536
That's exactly.

1443
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:19,545
Yechezkel ... that the main source of
of kedusha for kohanim is teaching.

1444
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:24,016
And as I emphasized before,

1445
02:00:24,383 --> 02:00:32,191
it means in other words, a kohen who
doesn’t teach, actually, I mean, is that

1446
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:40,866
not loses but his kedusha is not exalted
the way it should have been and a Yisrael

1447
02:00:40,866 --> 02:00:44,837
who teaches shares in kedushas kehunah.

1448
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:49,075
This is the reason

1449
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:55,481
for inserting Parshas
Moadot in Parshas Emor.

1450
02:00:57,049 --> 02:00:58,818
Which is very difficult to understand.

1451
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:01,354
You start Parshas Emor.

1452
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:02,855
What do you have in Parshas Emor?

1453
02:01:03,222 --> 02:01:04,991
First of all, tum'as meis.

1454
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:07,226
A kohen cannot defile
himself with a dead body.

1455
02:01:07,627 --> 02:01:10,062
Number two, pesul

1456
02:01:10,062 --> 02:01:14,734
nashim; whom a kohen is allowed to
marry, whom he is not allowed to marry.

1457
02:01:14,734 --> 02:01:18,738
Next, that baalei mumin should
not be offered on the mizbeach.

1458
02:01:18,738 --> 02:01:19,572
Again

1459
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:25,645
the law is addressed to the kohanim
because the kohanim used to decide

1460
02:01:25,645 --> 02:01:29,081
what is fit

1461
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:33,252
to be an offer and what
is unfit to be an offer.

1462
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:40,760
Suddenly, suddenly, we have
no transition, we realize that

1463
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:48,267
the Torah interrupts to tell us
about the laws of kehuna, and begins

1464
02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:53,539
to tell us a story about kviyas
moadim, the fixing of the yom tovim.

1465
02:01:54,573 --> 02:01:57,543
Eileh moadei hashem tikreu osam
mikraei kodesh eileh hem moadai.

1466
02:01:58,110 --> 02:02:00,980
I mean, what does it got to
do with the previous chapter?

1467
02:02:02,014 --> 02:02:03,949
What's the answer?

1468
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:11,757
The answer is that who was
who did fix the moadim?

1469
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:18,297
 To whom did the Torah entrust the kviyus moadim, to whom?

1470
02:02:18,631 --> 02:02:24,036
To the scholars, to the teachers, 
to the Sanhedrin.

1471
02:02:25,204 --> 02:02:28,040
Asher tikre'u osam mikra'ei kodesh.

1472
02:02:28,541 --> 02:02:29,975
Who are they?

1473
02:02:32,044 --> 02:02:33,279
The kohanim.

1474
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:38,884
That the Torah interrupts suddenly
because up to Parshas Moadim,

1475
02:02:38,884 --> 02:02:43,422
the Torah spoke about the kohen
who ministers to the Almighty.

1476
02:02:44,657 --> 02:02:47,460
Ki es lechem Elokav hu makriv.

1477
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:49,362
Now the Torah tells us something else.

1478
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:52,765
Yeah, but a kohen has
another job, another task.

1479
02:02:53,332 --> 02:02:56,836
His day is dedicated to another,
he's committed to something else,

1480
02:02:57,036 --> 02:02:59,672
namely, to scholarship and teaching.

1481
02:03:00,773 --> 02:03:03,642
And this is this identical is
kviyas moadim.

1482
02:03:06,846 --> 02:03:10,349
Does Yechezkel do it?

1483
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,118
Mention it?

1484
02:03:12,485 --> 02:03:14,720
What does Yechezkel say?

1485
02:03:15,821 --> 02:03:20,326
Ve'es torosai ve'es chukosai bechol moadai
yishmoru, ve'es shabsosai yekadeishu.

1486
02:03:21,026 --> 02:03:25,931
The kvias hamoadim, moadai
veshabsosai ..., the kviyas moadim,

1487
02:03:25,931 --> 02:03:32,438
kviyas moadim is performed by the
Sanhedrin, by the scholars, by the

1488
02:03:32,438 --> 02:03:34,540
teachers, meir ha'umah, of the nation.

1489
02:03:35,207 --> 02:03:38,411
And that’s why it is the job of the kohen.

1490
02:03:41,514 --> 02:03:42,915
What else?

1491
02:03:45,618 --> 02:03:47,119
What else?

1492
02:04:11,177 --> 02:04:18,517
Something else was, please, something
else was assigned to the kohanim.

1493
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:20,853
Namely, what?

1494
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:38,637
Namely, what?

1495
02:04:38,637 --> 02:04:44,343
Apparently to teach, apparently to
teach people on an abstract level,

1496
02:04:44,343 --> 02:04:49,215
just teach people theoretically,
theory is not good enough.

1497
02:04:50,282 --> 02:04:54,920
Whoever knows, what
should I say, the mood or

1498
02:04:56,489 --> 02:05:02,895
how yahadus wanted the people to act.

1499
02:05:02,895 --> 02:05:09,902
Of course, the first job is vishinantam
levanecha is to teach people.

1500
02:05:09,902 --> 02:05:15,641
But vishinantam levanecha does not mean
to teach them at an abstract level.

1501
02:05:15,908 --> 02:05:17,510
I mean, theory.

1502
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:23,182
Vishinantam levanecha refers
also to teach people how to act.

1503
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:26,585
And particularly the
principles of justice.

1504
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:34,193
Velo saguru mipnei ish, don't
be afraid of anybody.

1505
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:37,263
And you should remember
ki hamishpat l'Elokim hu,

1506
02:05:37,263 --> 02:05:38,864
judgment is up to the Almighty.

1507
02:05:40,633 --> 02:05:47,072
The fact is that the task

1508
02:05:47,072 --> 02:05:52,044
of the king, so the Rambam has
defined the task of the king

1509
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:56,248
in a two is a twofold one.

1510
02:05:56,248 --> 02:06:00,152
First of all, to defend the land
of Yisrael, to defend simply.

1511
02:06:00,753 --> 02:06:03,622
If military action is
necessary, the king should do it.

1512
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:11,196
And secondly, lishbor zroa reshaim,
to break the arm of the strong ones,

1513
02:06:11,196 --> 02:06:13,599
of the evildoers, to break their arm.

1514
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,801
This is administration of justice.

1515
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:19,505
And that's exactly what a
kohen is supposed to do.

1516
02:06:19,505 --> 02:06:22,474
And I want you to tell you,
I want you to understand.

1517
02:06:22,474 --> 02:06:27,046
We have many stories about
rabbonim of old, many stories.

1518
02:06:27,046 --> 02:06:31,016
Germany has its stories, Lithuania
has its stories and so forth

1519
02:06:31,016 --> 02:06:33,385
about rabbonim of old.

1520
02:06:33,385 --> 02:06:39,959
Is that stories do not revolve so
much about their scholarship.

1521
02:06:39,959 --> 02:06:41,493
Yes, we have many stories like that.

1522
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:43,596
But this is not the main topic

1523
02:06:44,129 --> 02:06:48,634
which actually has motivated
us to tell stories.

1524
02:06:49,668 --> 02:06:56,008
But the main topic was the their sense,
their sensitive conscience, their sense

1525
02:06:56,008 --> 02:06:59,511
of justice that the Rov possessed.

1526
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:05,084
For instance, there are many stories
about my grandfather and please, I

1527
02:07:05,084 --> 02:07:08,220
I'm not somehow trying to sell you

1528
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,822
my grandfather.

1529
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:13,192
First of all, he doesn't need to

1530
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:14,093
be sold.

1531
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:16,128
He doesn't need to be sold.

1532
02:07:17,529 --> 02:07:24,770
And secondly I'm not a Chassid, in the
sense that I tell stories in order

1533
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:28,474
to glorify and magnify a person.

1534
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:31,777
But my grandfather -- and
there are many stories

1535
02:07:31,777 --> 02:07:33,345
about his intellect.

1536
02:07:33,345 --> 02:07:35,581
He had a great intellect,
no doubt about it.

1537
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:42,788
He had in my opinion he had one of
the strongest intellects that

1538
02:07:42,788 --> 02:07:46,191
lived at the turn of the century.

1539
02:07:47,259 --> 02:07:49,828
Not only among Jews,
but among goyim as well.

1540
02:07:50,896 --> 02:07:52,731
His intellect was tremendous.

1541
02:07:53,399 --> 02:07:59,471
Had he been a philosopher, he would have
changed our science in any field, he would

1542
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:06,712
have changed in this particular discipline
upside down, completely, completely.

1543
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,716
But I'll tell you frankly,
this commands respect,

1544
02:08:10,716 --> 02:08:13,218
But I'm not impressed by it.

1545
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:25,330
He had an excellent head, he
was a genius, no doubt about it.

1546
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:28,367
Abstract thinker, and revolutionary.

1547
02:08:29,001 --> 02:08:34,540
As far as interpretation of halacha is
concerned, he revolutionized their work.

1548
02:08:35,107 --> 02:08:41,714
My father once told me, I'm still
acting like a Chassid now; my father

1549
02:08:41,714 --> 02:08:46,919
has told me that if not for Reb Chaim,
there wouldn't have been a possibility

1550
02:08:46,919 --> 02:08:51,924
to teach modern young men with a
good training in science, halacha.

1551
02:08:51,924 --> 02:08:58,197
He made it possible to teach halacha,
that halacha can be taught to anyone,

1552
02:08:58,197 --> 02:09:03,168
even those who are advanced in logical
analysis and they will find that the

1553
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:08,207
halacha is just as as exalted and
perhaps as abstract

1554
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:21,620
as the most advanced mathematical logic or analytical logic.

1555
02:09:22,721 --> 02:09:24,990
But what I'm impressed,
I'm not impressed by that.

1556
02:09:25,491 --> 02:09:28,494
The gift was given to 
him by The Almighty.

1557
02:09:28,994 --> 02:09:32,998
He presents some people He presents with a beautiful, precious gift,

1558
02:09:32,998 --> 02:09:34,967
but some people He 
doesn't give anything.

1559
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:44,009
This is not what
I .... I'm impressed by his heroism.

1560
02:09:44,476 --> 02:09:47,746
As far as social justice is concerned.

1561
02:09:48,347 --> 02:09:50,916
He was a real socialist,

1562
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:52,417
a real one.

1563
02:09:52,417 --> 02:09:56,121
Not a Marxist socialist, but

1564
02:09:56,121 --> 02:09:58,423
a real socialist with a most

1565
02:09:58,423 --> 02:10:02,194
sensitive conscience and sensitive heart.

1566
02:10:02,194 --> 02:10:04,863
And his unlimited courage.

1567
02:10:05,964 --> 02:10:07,366
And I'm saying

1568
02:10:07,366 --> 02:10:11,937
it, in order to explain to you what the
Torah has demanded of the kohen.

1569
02:10:12,371 --> 02:10:16,008
I mean, I'll tell you, you know, 
I have many stories.

1570
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:24,183
He actually fought.

1571
02:10:24,183 --> 02:10:28,620
There was a, please, 
I'm not trying to mislead you.

1572
02:10:29,188 --> 02:10:32,825
He once, there was a strike in Brisk.

1573
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:35,027
Who could strike in Brisk?

1574
02:10:35,027 --> 02:10:37,629
They didn’t manufacture anything.

1575
02:10:44,536 --> 02:10:50,142
But one article they
manufactured, namely, matzah.

1576
02:10:52,144 --> 02:10:55,614
So those who worked in
the matzah shops went

1577
02:10:55,614 --> 02:10:57,149
out on strike.

1578
02:10:57,583 --> 02:11:00,252
So Reb Chaim supported them.

1579
02:11:00,619 --> 02:11:04,957
He collected money in order to
feed the people who were on strike.

1580
02:11:05,457 --> 02:11:07,192
It was Brisk, it was not

1581
02:11:07,192 --> 02:11:12,998
New York or Boston, 19, 1979, it was
Brisk in the turn of the century.

1582
02:11:13,532 --> 02:11:15,534
He almost lost his rabbanus.

1583
02:11:16,301 --> 02:11:18,237
But he did not deviate.

1584
02:11:19,638 --> 02:11:23,041
I'll give you another example.

1585
02:11:23,809 --> 02:11:30,115
The halacha is, the law is that if
rachmanah litzlan two people die on

1586
02:11:30,115 --> 02:11:37,222
the same day, so the woman has been
buried first and the man afterward.

1587
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:38,423
The reason for it

1588
02:11:38,423 --> 02:11:39,992
is a different story.

1589
02:11:39,992 --> 02:11:45,964
So it happened in Brisk, it happened
that his most outstanding friend of

1590
02:11:45,964 --> 02:11:50,736
Reb Chaim, was a great scholar, was
a baal habayis, was a great scholar.

1591
02:11:50,736 --> 02:11:54,406
He actually was responsible for the fact
that Reb Chaim was elected rabbi of Brisk,

1592
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:56,875
otherwise he wouldn't have been elected.

1593
02:11:56,875 --> 02:12:02,481
He died on a certain morning
and the same time, a poor woman

1594
02:12:02,481 --> 02:12:04,549
in the Brisker ghetto died.

1595
02:12:05,884 --> 02:12:10,856
And it was in the
winter, the day is short.

1596
02:12:10,856 --> 02:12:18,030
So the gabaiei Chevra Kadisha
figured out that ... as far as the

1597
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:22,734
burial of the poor woman concerned,
it will be late, it would make no

1598
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:24,736
difference whether she would be buried

1599
02:12:24,736 --> 02:12:26,171
at night or in the morning.

1600
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:31,610
In Lithuania, they used to bury dead
at night, or in the morning, because

1601
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:34,413
no one will come to the funeral anyway.

1602
02:12:34,413 --> 02:12:38,884
But the other, Reb Chaim Zalman Lipshitz, 
this was his name.

1603
02:12:38,884 --> 02:12:42,788
I mean, he was the
pillar of the community.

1604
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:45,457
In the morning, you have

1605
02:12:45,457 --> 02:12:48,460
a big send-off.

1606
02:12:54,132 --> 02:13:00,238
But in the evening, not
many people will come.

1607
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:06,378
And they decided to bury him first
and to prepare him for burial first.

1608
02:13:07,212 --> 02:13:09,648
So Reb Chaim heard the story.

1609
02:13:09,648 --> 02:13:15,754
He sent a messenger to them, to
Chevra Kadisha, to stop preparing

1610
02:13:15,754 --> 02:13:23,729
Reb Chaim Zalman Lipshitz, but
to bury the poor woman first.

1611
02:13:23,729 --> 02:13:27,666
And if his burial will take
place at night, we can't help it.

1612
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:36,274
So the Chevra Kadisha ignored his orders,
instructions, and continued to prepare

1613
02:13:36,274 --> 02:13:40,512
Reb Chaim Zalman Lipshitz for burial.

1614
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:44,916
So Reb Chaim took his cane,
put on his coat, and told the

1615
02:13:44,916 --> 02:13:46,218
shammes -- the shammes told me, the

1616
02:13:46,218 --> 02:13:47,853
shammes who actually was present there

1617
02:13:47,853 --> 02:13:50,655
 he told me this story -- told the shammes, come on.

1618
02:13:50,655 --> 02:13:54,159
And he went to the house of
Reb Chaim Zalman Lipshitz.

1619
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:58,397
His greatest friend, his most outstanding friend,

1620
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:01,867
who sacrifed himself actually, 

1621
02:14:02,634 --> 02:14:07,472
in order to elect
Reb Chaim the rabbi of Brisk.

1622
02:14:08,507 --> 02:14:11,510
He went to the house and he
told the Chevra Kadisha to leave him

1623
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:20,619
and to go to the
ghetto and bury the woman first.

1624
02:14:21,286 --> 02:14:23,655
This is his tremendous courage.

1625
02:14:23,655 --> 02:14:31,129
Not because people did criticize him, or

1626
02:14:31,129 --> 02:14:33,465
he lost a few of his supporters.

1627
02:14:33,465 --> 02:14:37,369
It is courage because he
acted against himself.

1628
02:14:37,369 --> 02:14:41,540
He himself mourned the
passing of his best friend.

1629
02:14:42,674 --> 02:14:47,012
He sacrificed his own
self, his own emotions.

1630
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:51,716
After all he reciprocated this friendship.

1631
02:14:51,716 --> 02:14:52,884
Though he couldn't help it.

1632
02:14:52,884 --> 02:14:55,821
He was a prisoner of the law.

1633
02:14:56,721 --> 02:15:01,460
And a man has to sometimes have a lot
of courage in order to be a prisoner

1634
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:05,263
of the law and to carry the law out.

1635
02:15:06,198 --> 02:15:09,134
I can tell you hundreds 
of such stories.

1636
02:15:09,134 --> 02:15:11,837
There are no nissim,
there are no miracles.

1637
02:15:13,405 --> 02:15:21,880
But people, a great man, in
theory, a great man who has a

1638
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,782
great intellect, should also have

1639
02:15:23,782 --> 02:15:25,951
a great heart and a sensitive heart.

1640
02:15:26,318 --> 02:15:28,587
And have particularly courage.

1641
02:15:28,587 --> 02:15:31,356
Velo saguru mipnei ish.

1642
02:15:32,858 --> 02:15:35,694
Velo saguru mipnei ish.

1643
02:15:35,694 --> 02:15:41,733
And that's exactly what the
Torah demanded from the kohen.

1644
02:15:41,733 --> 02:15:43,535
Does Yechezkel say it?

1645
02:15:44,636 --> 02:15:46,671
Does Yechezkel say it?

1646
02:15:47,205 --> 02:15:50,208
Ve'al riv eileh ya'amdu.

1647
02:15:50,208 --> 02:15:54,212
Wherever there is litigation,
wherever there is conflict,

1648
02:15:54,212 --> 02:15:57,149
wherever two people disagree with

1649
02:15:57,149 --> 02:16:01,753
each other, and the Rav has to
intervene, he's eileh ya'amdu,

1650
02:16:01,753 --> 02:16:04,856
he should stand, stand upright.

1651
02:16:04,856 --> 02:16:12,230
Not give in, not compromise, but
enforce and implement the law.

1652
02:16:13,331 --> 02:16:18,737
This is the second, the kohen is
a teacher, he is also his job is

1653
02:16:18,737 --> 02:16:21,339
to enforce, to administer justice.

1654
02:16:26,711 --> 02:16:31,249
And then, what else?

1655
02:16:31,249 --> 02:16:32,584
What is the third aspect

1656
02:16:33,218 --> 02:16:39,224
which the navi has formulated
as far as kehuna is concerned?

1657
02:16:39,791 --> 02:16:43,161
Not the navi, but actually this is
the Chumash, the Torah SheBichsav.

1658
02:16:43,161 --> 02:16:44,262
Yes?

1659
02:16:56,374 --> 02:17:03,648
[Inaudible]

1660
02:17:17,696 --> 02:17:27,806
I believe, I believe that the
third principle is to be found

1661
02:17:28,506 --> 02:17:30,642
in the haftarah of Tazria.

1662
02:17:30,642 --> 02:17:33,678
Who remembers the haftarah of Tazria?

1663
02:17:47,192 --> 02:17:49,060
Alright, read it?

1664
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:51,696
What is the story?

1665
02:17:52,464 --> 02:17:55,767
The story there was Naaman.

1666
02:18:01,139 --> 02:18:05,243
There was Naaman who was a leper.

1667
02:18:06,811 --> 02:18:09,814
There was Naaman who was a leper.

1668
02:18:09,814 --> 02:18:12,150
And he came to Eretz Yisrael

1669
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:18,223
to Elisha, and Elisha healed
him, cured him of his leprosy.

1670
02:18:18,223 --> 02:18:22,694
And Geichazi wanted to see what
was his opinion that Elisha

1671
02:18:22,694 --> 02:18:25,030
should accept remuneration

1672
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:29,334
a fee for for his miraculous job.

1673
02:18:29,334 --> 02:18:34,172
And Elisha refused to accept,
and Geichazi disobeying Elisha's

1674
02:18:34,172 --> 02:18:41,880
orders, ran after Naaman and got
some gifts from him, and he was

1675
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:45,016
driven out by Elisha 
from his house,

1676
02:18:45,016 --> 02:18:47,786
and Geichazi himself 
became a leper.

1677
02:18:47,786 --> 02:18:49,254
This is the haftarah.

1678
02:18:49,254 --> 02:18:49,988
Correct?

1679
02:18:49,988 --> 02:18:51,823
What has it got to do with the parsha?

1680
02:18:51,823 --> 02:18:54,259
The parsha speaks about metzora, correct.

1681
02:18:54,259 --> 02:18:58,763
But what does the story of
Elisha got to do with the parsha,

1682
02:18:59,097 --> 02:19:00,699
with the parsha of Tazria?

1683
02:19:00,699 --> 02:19:03,768
Tazria is the parsha
of metzoraim, correct.

1684
02:19:06,438 --> 02:19:12,777
And the Haftarah is about a metzora who
was cured by a Jewish prophet, by Elisha.

1685
02:19:13,178 --> 02:19:17,816
Is this so important to
know, I mean, about Naaman?

1686
02:19:18,883 --> 02:19:21,119
What's important here
is the refusal on the

1687
02:19:21,119 --> 02:19:30,328
part of Elisha to accept remuneration
or a fee for his curing of Naaman.

1688
02:19:30,328 --> 02:19:33,164
Why did he refuse?

1689
02:19:34,165 --> 02:19:36,267
Why did he refuse?

1690
02:19:37,936 --> 02:19:44,409
Because the main task of
the navi and the kohen is to

1691
02:19:44,409 --> 02:19:50,715
impress, to enhance the prestige,

1692
02:19:50,715 --> 02:19:55,587
of Yahadus among Jews 
and non-Jews alike.

1693
02:19:56,888 --> 02:20:02,827
Naaman was very impressed by the
miraculous deed on the part of Elisha.

1694
02:20:03,094 --> 02:20:06,498
As a matter of fact, he was
ready, I mean, to convert, and he

1695
02:20:06,498 --> 02:20:09,667
asked Elisha about avodah zarah.

1696
02:20:09,667 --> 02:20:14,806
Because when he walks into the temple,
with the king of Aram, he has to bow

1697
02:20:14,806 --> 02:20:17,142
when the king bows before the idol.

1698
02:20:17,142 --> 02:20:21,379
So he asked Elisha whether
he's allowed to do so or not.

1699
02:20:22,547 --> 02:20:31,222
But Elisha considered the deed on
the part of Geichazi as wrong because

1700
02:20:31,222 --> 02:20:36,194
accepting of gifts
would undermine the high

1701
02:20:36,194 --> 02:20:43,368
prestige which, the high prestige
of respect which Elisha, I mean,

1702
02:20:43,368 --> 02:20:46,971
which Naaman had for Elisha.

1703
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:55,613
The job of the kohen is like that of the
navi, lekadesh shem yisrael barabbim.

1704
02:20:56,214 --> 02:20:59,918
And that's exactly what Geichazi misunderstood.

1705
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:09,794
And that is the book of Vayikra.

1706
02:21:10,462 --> 02:21:16,134
It's a book of the redemption,
of the final redemption,

1707
02:21:16,134 --> 02:21:18,970
it's also the book of kehuna.

1708
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:21,239
It's not just a ministering kehuna.

1709
02:21:21,239 --> 02:21:25,577
Not just a cultic group which
engages in cultic activities.

1710
02:21:25,577 --> 02:21:28,112
No, it's more than that, by far more.

1711
02:21:28,112 --> 02:21:32,484
It's a group of teachers, it's a group
of administrators of justice, people with

1712
02:21:32,484 --> 02:21:38,756
a sensitive heart, sensitive mind, and
people who engage in chessed and don't

1713
02:21:38,756 --> 02:21:44,128
expect any compensation any remuneration
for their part, for their chessed.

1714
02:21:44,128 --> 02:21:48,199
And let me at the end in 
conclusion say the following.

1715
02:21:48,199 --> 02:21:54,806
Our Torah has been exposed
to attacks since the days of

1716
02:21:54,806 --> 02:21:57,442
revelation at Mount Sinai.

1717
02:22:02,247 --> 02:22:06,217
The Torah was the target for

1718
02:22:06,217 --> 02:22:11,856
the most vicious attacks,
abuse and ridicule.

1719
02:22:13,491 --> 02:22:20,899
Maimonides in his letter to Teiman, to
the kehillah inTeiman, to the community

1720
02:22:20,899 --> 02:22:30,742
in Yemen, says that our enemies, our
antagonists, are planning to destroy us in

1721
02:22:30,742 --> 02:22:36,247
two ways, in a double manner: physically,
of course, Hitler tried it, just in our

1722
02:22:36,247 --> 02:22:42,420
time, as well as spiritually,
to erase Jewish identity.

1723
02:22:43,254 --> 02:22:46,658
And Maimonides says that

1724
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:53,965
nevertheless, no matter how strong the
conspiracy is to destroy the Jew, he will

1725
02:22:53,965 --> 02:22:57,068
not succeed, they'll fail
in achieving this objective.

1726
02:22:57,068 --> 02:22:58,903
Maimonides in Iggeres Teiman.

1727
02:22:58,903 --> 02:23:01,839
He quotes a pasuk of Isaiah:

1728
02:23:03,041 --> 02:23:07,745
Kol kli alayich lo yitzlach,
any weapon formed against

1729
02:23:07,745 --> 02:23:09,781
thee will not be successful.

1730
02:23:09,781 --> 02:23:15,286
Vechol lashon takum itach lamishpat, and
every tongue which will sit in judgment

1731
02:23:15,286 --> 02:23:18,690
over thee, tarshi'i, you will condemn it.

1732
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:22,460
It means that our antagonists will fail

1733
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:23,661
as far as

1734
02:23:23,661 --> 02:23:29,200
both points are concerned.

1735
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:32,770
They'll never destroy
the Jew physically, nor

1736
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:36,341
will they make the Jew
forget his identity.

1737
02:23:37,976 --> 02:23:44,716
But even nowadays I have hopes that
the Jew, I mean, there was in 1945

1738
02:23:44,716 --> 02:23:52,790
after the Holocaust, I mean, when
became known to the world the Jew, I

1739
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:57,829
actually, not I I mustn't say I had
great doubts, chas veshalom, but I

1740
02:23:57,829 --> 02:24:04,235
was very pessimistic, very sad about
the prospects of the Jew to survive.

1741
02:24:05,470 --> 02:24:12,210
Now somehow, of course, a big
role is played by the Medinas Yisrael.

1742
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:18,249
It has a tremendous
role. It is somehow the symbol of

1743
02:24:18,249 --> 02:24:25,456
indestructibility of
the Jew, spiritually as

1744
02:24:25,456 --> 02:24:28,826
well as physically.

1745
02:24:29,727 --> 02:24:33,598
It's an old story, Maimonides did
not say anything new, and we all

1746
02:24:33,598 --> 02:24:36,067
hope that the tongue which sits in

1747
02:24:36,067 --> 02:24:41,472
judgment over us as well as
the weapon which our enemies

1748
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:44,509
forge against us will fail.

1749
02:24:45,777 --> 02:24:53,484
However, if there is a book in the whole
Torah ..., there is no other book which

1750
02:24:53,484 --> 02:25:01,726
will ... by our antagonists as the book of
Leviticus, of the the code of the priests.

1751
02:25:04,929 --> 02:25:07,799
Since the days, what should I say,

1752
02:25:07,799 --> 02:25:16,107
of ... Christianity,
namely ... Chazal, There was

1753
02:25:16,107 --> 02:25:26,384
an organized attack against kehuna and
the book of kehuna, namely, 

1754
02:25:28,519 --> 02:25:30,788
Sefer Vayikra.

1755
02:25:31,322 --> 02:25:40,064
...even among bible critics, when they
come to Sefer Vayikra, so they enjoy it,

1756
02:25:41,733 --> 02:25:45,436
they enjoy the opportunity very
much, the opportunity to abuse and

1757
02:25:45,436 --> 02:25:53,978
to ridicule and to destroy with their
cynicism, with sarcasm Sefer Vayikra

1758
02:25:53,978 --> 02:25:56,214
of Chamishah Chumshei Torah.

1759
02:25:56,214 --> 02:26:01,185
Because by destroying Vayikra, the
book of kehuna, they destroy kehuna.

1760
02:26:01,185 --> 02:26:04,722
By destroying kehuna, they
destroy the Beis Hamikdash.

1761
02:26:04,722 --> 02:26:08,860
By destroying the Beis Hamikdash, they
destroy all the hopes which we have

1762
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:10,795
to come back into the Beis Hamikdash.

1763
02:26:11,329 --> 02:26:15,933
By destroying the Beis Hamikdash and our
hopes for Moshiach, they destroy also,

1764
02:26:16,834 --> 02:26:20,171
they destroy also the Jewish identity.

1765
02:26:21,072 --> 02:26:25,510
The people to whom the land was promised
are not the Jews, but some other people,

1766
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:28,613
and I don't have to tell it to you.

1767
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:40,591
And how did we react to our
enemies and antagonists in

1768
02:26:40,591 --> 02:26:43,261
this regard how did we react?

1769
02:26:43,261 --> 02:26:44,929
What did we do

1770
02:26:44,929 --> 02:26:46,597
throughout the ages?

1771
02:26:46,864 --> 02:26:51,402
We have a funny method how to
react to such attacks, vicious

1772
02:26:51,402 --> 02:27:00,378
attacks, to false accusations, to
misinterpretation and to lying.

1773
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:04,882
We have a funny approach to it.

1774
02:27:05,283 --> 02:27:09,153
The Ramban in his letter, you
know, you all know the phrase.

1775
02:27:09,153 --> 02:27:11,088
Let me paraphrase the Ramban.

1776
02:27:11,088 --> 02:27:14,692
The Ramban in his letter upon his
arrival in Eretz Yisrael, this is the

1777
02:27:14,692 --> 02:27:18,796
last letter we have from him, we don't
know where he disappeared, writes to

1778
02:27:18,796 --> 02:27:25,069
the son about the desolation and the
churban which prevails in Eretz Yisrael.

1779
02:27:25,069 --> 02:27:27,638
And ... is his famous statement.

1780
02:27:27,638 --> 02:27:30,474
Kol hakadosh beyoser chorev beyoser.

1781
02:27:30,474 --> 02:27:36,013
Whatever is the most most
holy to us is most desolate.

1782
02:27:36,447 --> 02:27:47,091
And I can say this was the approach
of the Jew to all attacks on

1783
02:27:47,091 --> 02:27:48,693
the part of his enemies.

1784
02:27:49,227 --> 02:27:57,668
Kol mah shemul'ag beyoser, anything
which is most ridiculed, ridiculed the

1785
02:27:57,668 --> 02:28:01,806
most, any other spiritual value or Jewish

1786
02:28:01,806 --> 02:28:08,946
institution which is the most abused,
abused the most, is chaviv aleinu beyoser,

1787
02:28:08,946 --> 02:28:14,085
is dear and we cherish it the more.

1788
02:28:15,653 --> 02:28:21,826
Interesting is that Vayikra was chosen
to be read between Pesach and Shavuos.

1789
02:28:25,162 --> 02:28:26,664
This is the Sefer Vayikra.

1790
02:28:26,664 --> 02:28:30,201
Shemini is the first
Shabbos after Vayikra.

1791
02:28:30,201 --> 02:28:31,502
And before

1792
02:28:31,502 --> 02:28:37,842
we are ready to celebrate Shavuos, we
have to read the tochacha in Bechukosai,

1793
02:28:37,842 --> 02:28:44,882
we need to read not only the tochacha
but the Parshas Bamidbar as well.

1794
02:28:44,882 --> 02:28:49,921
And it means that when you go
to Har Sinai on Shavuos, we have

1795
02:28:49,921 --> 02:28:52,490
the whole Torah in our hand.

1796
02:28:52,490 --> 02:28:56,560
But in particular, we have Sefer Vayikra.

1797
02:28:56,961 --> 02:29:04,635
And it's an old minhag, it's mentioned in
Medrash, that you start with a child to

1798
02:29:04,635 --> 02:29:07,271
start teaching the child Sefer Vayikra.

1799
02:29:07,705 --> 02:29:11,175
This is the book, it's the book of kehuna.

1800
02:29:11,175 --> 02:29:13,744
And every Jew should act as

1801
02:29:13,744 --> 02:29:15,179
if he were a kohen.

1802
02:29:15,179 --> 02:29:19,617
After all, kehuna was not given to
a single person, to a single tribe.

1803
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:23,854
Vihyisem li mamleches kohanim vegoy
kadosh, you'll be a kingdom of kohanim.

1804
02:29:23,854 --> 02:29:25,389
Every Jew can become a kohen.

1805
02:29:25,389 --> 02:29:26,824
How can he become a kohen?

1806
02:29:26,824 --> 02:29:32,663
By teaching, by administering
justice and by engaging in chessed.

1807
02:29:33,064 --> 02:29:35,666
A mekadesh shem Shamayim.

1808
02:29:36,367 --> 02:29:38,536
That's all.
