1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,435
They are elementary things.

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:09,642
Actually, I'll deal with terminology,
but in my opinion, halachic

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:16,716
terminology is very important
and each term expresses an idea.

4
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:24,891
And I'm going to deal with the terminology
centered around Jewish holidays and

5
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,327
I'll try -- I mean, to somehow to

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,803
-- to follow, I mean, the lead
of terminology and to analyze

7
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,940
the very essence of Jewish holidays.

8
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,781
It is a strange -- or shall I say
paper that I sat down to write.

9
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,918
I had something else in
mind, not to debate here.

10
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,721
What came into this
world is a different one,

11
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:04,164
but I believe that you'll follow
me and it will help you, I mean,

12
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,302
in understanding the Jewish
philosophy of holidays.

13
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:18,211
When we speak of festivals, we
must distinguish between two terms.

14
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:30,123
One term is yom kadosh, or the
way people in their halachic

15
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,560
lingo say kedushat hayom.

16
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:41,134
The difference is that with yom
kadosh, is a kadosh an adjective?

17
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,905
When you say kedushat hayom,
is the kedushah substantive?

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,276
Well, this one group of holidays which can

19
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:57,250
be described as yom kadosh,
or yamim kedoshim, or those

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,185
who possess kedushat hayom.

21
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,990
There is another group of holidays which

22
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,829
we call or we classify as
Yom Tov or yamim tovim.

23
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:21,441
Both terms, that of kedushat
hayom and that of the Yom

24
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,577
Tov, are of biblical origin.

25
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,149
They are certainly of
Talmudic origin as well.

26
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,687
Kedushat hayom, the whole
concept of kedushat hayom, there

27
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,190
are days which are endowed with holiness.

28
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:42,795
Usually, when we speak about days,
I mean, we never think of something

29
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:51,004
substantive, of something having
a content, an essence in it.

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,207
In philosophy, we call
it sensia, substantia.

31
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,977
To us, time is not something living.

32
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,413
It's not

33
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,352
a subject to which attributes can be

34
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:12,258
ascribed and traits, actually, predicated.

35
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:19,132
To us, time is like -- in the Kantian
manner is just -- it is actually a

36
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,134
mathematical concept, nothing else.

37
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:26,339
Now matter and physics have
combined time with space, so it

38
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,142
is empty, as empty as space is.

39
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:37,050
It is just one of the coordinate
system -- it's one coordinate of a system

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,852
within which we try to explain the world

41
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,755
-- I mean, the cosmic dynamics.

42
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,959
Judaism time was something else,
was some -- a living entity.

43
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,662
There was substance to time.

44
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,631
There was individuality to time.

45
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:56,603
There was essence to time and
you could ascribe attributes to

46
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:01,307
time in the same manner as you
do ascribe attributes to people.

47
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,179
That’s a nice person, a good person, 
a handsom person,

48
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,815
a holy person or an evil person.

49
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:18,191
And all this speaks of time, holy
time, holy day, an evil day, a sad day.

50
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,294
We actually, as a matter of fact,
in our colloquial we use in all

51
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,198
languages, even Yiddish and German
and any language, an evil day.

52
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,937
But while, I mean, modern man
thinks that an evil day means

53
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,173
a day on which evil -- somehow
an evil event took place.

54
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:41,714
In Yahadus, say arur hayom, it
means the day itself is cursed and

55
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,417
the same applies to positive attributes.

56
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:50,523
When we say holy day, it means the
day itself is holy, not a day in which

57
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:54,060
man somehow experiences holiness.

58
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,429
No, this already rationalization.

59
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,633
I mean, when we approach Yahadus, we
should, many time, try to understand

60
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,502
Yahadus in its own categories.

61
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,874
Whether they appear fresh and new
to us or perhaps old-fashioned

62
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:12,078
is completely irrelevant, but we
have to understand Yahadus in its

63
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,848
unique singular categories
and time in Yahadus

64
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,787
is something substantive, something -- essential.

65
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,755
It is an individuality.

66
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,425
I would even say it's a personality.

67
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:30,496
This is not just a part of a
mathematical coordinate system.

68
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,902
So hence, the pasuk says,

69
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:41,441
"Vayevarech Elokim es yom ha'shevi'i
va'yekadesh oso," God has blessed

70
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,812
the seventh day and hallowed it.

71
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,551
In Nechemiah, we find

72
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:59,125
that on Rosh Hashanah and Ezra recited
the law and the people cried, 

73
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:05,198
so "V'ha'Levi'im machshim ha'am," and the
Levites tried to silence the people,

74
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,571
saying that it is forbidden to cry on 
Rosh Hashanah,

75
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,707
that they described the
day, the character on the day,

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:20,947
"Ki kadosh hayom l'Adoneinu," the
day is holy and dedicated to God.

77
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:27,920
The term Yom Tov is also mentioned
in the Bible, namely where?

78
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,355
Where?

79
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,991
Yom tov in the Bible?

80
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,325
Where?

81
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,460
In Megillah, correct.

82
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,764
In the Scroll of Esther, "Osim es

83
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:42,602
yom arbaah asar l'chodesh
Adar simchah u'mishteh v'yom tov."

84
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:50,543
Of course, we, in our halachic
lingo, use both terms continually.

85
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,980
Sometimes, we

86
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,816
speak about kedushas hayom and
sometimes, we speak about Yom Tov.

87
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:01,320
Quite often, we don't discriminate
between these two terms.

88
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:07,260
Remarkable is one detail, why we apply

89
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:15,134
the epithet of Yom Tov to all
holidays without any discrimination.

90
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:21,674
We call Pesach Yom Tov, we call Shavuos
Yom Tov, Rosh Hashanah Yom Tov, even

91
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,211
Yom Kippur we call Yom Tov, and Sukkos.

92
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,815
We have never said about
Shabbos that it's a Yom Tov.

93
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,082
Never.

94
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,884
Shabbos v'Yom Tov

95
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:39,592
I mean, if it's two extremes, two
poles, and man somehow swings like a

96
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:44,597
pendulum between those two poles, but you
have never found, we have come across in

97
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:53,406
it, in our halachic literature or in the
Bible, I mean, or in any commentary that

98
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,542
Shabbos be called and termed Yom Tov.

99
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,379
Apparently, Shabbos is not Yom Tov.

100
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,316
Why?

101
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,653
But in a way, we have
been dealing now with

102
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,057
the kedushat hayom, 
with yamim kedoshim,

103
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,001
but for instance, Chanukah or Purim
are Yamim Tovim mi'd'Rabbanan, yet

104
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,504
they do not possess kedushat hayom.

105
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,307
They are not yamim kedoshim.

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,816
Concerning Purim, we have already pointed
out the description of the day as Yom Tov 

107
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,852
is mentioned in the Megillah.

108
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,990
As regards Chanukah and, of
course, Chanukah is not mentioned

109
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,291
in the kisvei ha'kodesh.

110
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,664
There is no Megillas Chanukah in
kisvei ha'kodesh, so we have to

111
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,802
simply to refer to Megillas Taanit.

112
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:03,576
In Megillas Taanit, quoted by the
Gemara in Shabbos, Daf Chaf-Alef, I

113
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:12,952
believe, Amud Beis, the Braisa states,
"L'shanah ha'ba asa'um yom tov b'hallel

114
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,689
v'hoda'a o' b'simchah u'v'hallel," so

115
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,523
the name Yom Tov 

116
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,759
is applicable to Chanukah, too.

117
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,329
However, as

118
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:29,669
we mentioned, they lack kedushas hayom,
while Shabbos and Gimmel Regalim and

119
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,837
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur

120
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,509
are yamim kedoshim, Chanukah 
and Purim are yemei chol.

121
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,513
Now, let me ask a simple question.

122
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,049
What does kedushas hayom mean?

123
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,050
What is it, actually?

124
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,151
(Audience member) Issur melachah.

125
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,285
Correct.

126
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,756
When we say that the
day is holy, "Ki kodesh

127
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:55,361
hayom l'Adoneinu," what does
it mean in halachic terms?

128
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:06,505
What kedushas hayom means at the very
outset is simply -- kedushas hayom denotes

129
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,375
or signifies an inherent endowment.

130
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:16,315
This I told you before, or shall I say
it is a -- now it has become a colloquial

131
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:27,126
term, a charisma enmeshed or hidden in
the very substance or essence of the day.

132
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,800
And this charisma, this inner quality,
it's a mysterious quality which

133
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:44,410
is hidden in the very essence of the
day, expresses itself halachically as

134
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,015
it was said here in issur melachah,

135
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,950
prohibition against work.

136
00:10:53,486 --> 00:11:00,092
Chanukah and Purim do not
precipitate issur melachah.

137
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:06,365
Apparently, they lack that
specific endowment which usually

138
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,902
expresses itself in issur melachah.

139
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:16,542
Wherever there is no issur melachah,
one cannot speak of kedushas hayom.

140
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:24,650
The latter is inseparable from the
idea of absolute rest, but not so

141
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:33,392
much rest as absolute cessation or
complete stoppage, discontinuation.

142
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,464
I mean, all right, it's easy
to say that the kedushas hayom

143
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,033
expresses itself in issur melachah.

144
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,934
I mean,

145
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,870
could somebody prove it
here by quoting a text?

146
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:52,244
We say b'Retzei in Birkas Hamazon,
"Ki yom zeh gadol v'kadosh", "lishbas

147
00:11:52,244 --> 00:12:00,286
bo v'lanuach bo b'ahavah k'mitzvas
retzonecha," for this is a great

148
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,756
and holy day dedicated

149
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:12,698
lishbos bo, to cessation or
discontinuation and to rest, of course,

150
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,736
 with law in accordance with thy will. 

151
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:24,977
Apparently, the adjectives
gadol v'kadosh are

152
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:31,650
linked up, inseparably linked
up with shevisah and menuchah.

153
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:37,256
And there is no doubt that shevisah is by
far a more important attribute of the day

154
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,660
than menuchah, leaving off and resting.

155
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:51,270
Now, let's not forget that the term
kedushah quite often in the Bible has the

156
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,741
connotation of separateness, 
of being separate, 

157
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,180
or it has the meaning of

158
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,617
being not common or a meaning of

159
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:10,556
uncommonness, singularity,
distinctiveness.

160
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:17,429
As a matter of fact, the term
kodesh also has the connotation of

161
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:22,501
distance, of being remote, 
being far, far away.

162
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:29,208
When we say, "Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh
Havayah Tzevakos melo chol ha'aretz  kevodo," 

163
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,946
 so you indicate this great paradox in our religious experience, 

164
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,149
 that on the one hand, to experience God as remote, 

165
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:43,856
 as distant, as abiding in infinity, in the recesses of transcendence, 

166
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,391
 and on the other hand, 

167
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,794
God is my companion, right here.

168
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,101
"Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh," remote,
exalted, above and beyond everything,

169
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,606
above and beyond the cosmos, the
great -- the boundless universe 

170
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:07,813
and the same time, "melo chol ha'aretz
kevodo," I mean, He fills out the universe 

171
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,149
 and He's right here near me. 

172
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:19,592
 That's why Chabad, the two terms, mimalei kol almin v'sovev kol almin are so important. 

173
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,962
 So, basically, kedushah means many times distance, 

174
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,832
 remoteness, being unreachable. 

175
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:34,740
Therefore, when we say Shabbosos
v'Yamim Tovim, that they're being

176
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:42,214
set aside as days of rest and
discontinuation or leaving off or

177
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,886
cessation, are not ordinary, common days.

178
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:55,828
Whoever possesses kedushah cannot be a
common entity, cannot be a common person.

179
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,532
There is something unique about him,
something singular, something different.

180
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,739
So if Shabbosos v'Yamim Tovim are
endowed with kedushah, it means

181
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,141
that endowed with uniqueness.

182
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:14,780
They are many times remote
from the ordinary way of

183
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,283
life or from ordinary days.

184
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,387
They are not ordinary;
they're not common days.

185
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,291
They are -- what shall I use
the term -- they are freaks.

186
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,325
They're different.

187
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,330
You know very well, sometimes
you may admire a freak and

188
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,531
sometimes, he's very annoying.

189
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,999
A freak can be very annoying.

190
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,069
So Shabbos and Yom Tov can be
terribly annoying, 

191
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,673
annoying and

192
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,577
interfering with our everyday
conveniences and little pleasures.

193
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,648
It's exactly the -- what shall I say?

194
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,918
This reflects exactly kedushah.

195
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,155
Even -- Yahadus as such

196
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:01,860
is sometimes very annoying and
very unwelcome to the ordinary man.

197
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,900
They're unusual days.

198
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,303
What happens on that day?

199
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:19,178
Nothing in particular, just
the world today, its routine

200
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,014
is interrupted on that day.

201
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,285
What happens on that day?

202
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:32,891
The established program of human
activities -- what is that program?

203
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,495
What does that -- where is this
program mentioned in the Bible?

204
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:41,700
The human being has a certain
routine, a certain program.

205
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,335
This program has

206
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:48,874
not changed over the
centuries and millennia.

207
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,509
It's the same.

208
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:56,348
The program, in my opinion, and you
will find yes, correct, I believe it's beautifully-

209
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,118
 described in Barchi Nafshi.

210
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,987
"Tizrach ha'shemesh -- ha'shemesh
yei'aseifun v'el me'onosam yirbatzum.

211
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,124
"Tizrach ha'shemesh -- ha'shemesh
yei'aseifun v'el me'onosam yirbatzum.

212
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,127
Yeitzei adam lefaalo v'laavodaso 
adei arev." 

213
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,432
The sun rises, they slink away, 
the young lions,

214
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,903
and they hide in their dens.

215
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,743
Man goes forth unto his work and
to his labor

216
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,446
until the evening.

217
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,787
That routine of yizrach ha'shemesh yeitzei
adam lefaalo v'laavodaso adei arev, and

218
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:41,727
that monotony is discontinued if ba'yom
is not an ordinary day

219
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,063
but a yom gadol v'kadosh,

220
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,299
a great day and a holy day.

221
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:55,808
 Of course, even on a yom gadol 
v'kadosh, the sun rises. 

222
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:03,816
The universe is not different, certainly
the young lions crouch in their dens,

223
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,819
on a yom gadol v'kadosh, 

224
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:11,723
but man does not
go forth unto his work or to his labor.

225
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,558
No.

226
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,462
Today, man has a different,
a unique schedule.

227
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,930
What the schedule is, we don't know.

228
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,066
This distinctiveness,

229
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,404
as far as the schedule is 
concerned, the change 

230
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:30,242
sanctifies and hallows the day

231
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,646
and makes it a yom gadol v'kadosh.

232
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,251
Why is it a yom gadol v'kadosh?

233
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,221
Because it is a unique day.

234
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:51,296
The question arises, what is
the nature and the essence not

235
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,701
of a yom gadol v'kadosh, 
but of yom tov 

236
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,738
That is deprived of kedushas hayom?

237
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,840
Chanukah and Purim are
deprived of kedushas hayom.

238
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,444
They are stripped of kedushas
hayom, melachah is permissible.

239
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:13,952
On the one hand, the day of
Chanukah or Purim, it does not

240
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:18,157
differ from the ordinary day.

241
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,960
On Chanukah, Purim, man goes forth with

242
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,396
work and to his labor until

243
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,397
the evening.

244
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,699
On the other hand,

245
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:38,710
man is called to act or to engage
with specific action, which the halacha

246
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,182
calls mitzvos hayom on those days.

247
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:49,721
For instance, on Purim, a man is
obligated to recite the Megillah;

248
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,024
on Chanukah, to light the candles, to say

249
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:58,964
Hallel, to abstain from
hesped v'taanis, from fasting

250
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,067
and public mourning.

251
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,140
The conclusion is obvious.

252
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,512
Even Chanukah and Purim are endowed
with some charisma, 

253
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,081
with some singular

254
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,819
quality not to be found
in an ordinary day.

255
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,959
Of course, they are not yamim
kedoshim, yet they are -- and this

256
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:32,331
is my turn -- yamim tovim, of course,
but I would say yamim kevu'im.

257
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:36,435
They're being singled
out or yamim muvcharim.

258
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,470
They have been selected.

259
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,608
Out of 365 days, eight
days of Chanukah and one

260
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,609
or two days of Purim

261
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,345
have been selected and set apart.

262
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,248
Then, they are also different.

263
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,154
There is somehow individuality.

264
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,191
There is character to them.

265
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,830
Yet it's obvious

266
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,001
that they are not ordinary days.

267
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:17,142
So if this be so, so the question arises,
what is the difference between yamim

268
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,811
kedoshim or yamim tovim

269
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,315
or rather not to -- because, to
avoid confusion, I'll call it

270
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,784
yamim kevu'im or yamim muvcharim.

271
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,185
What's the difference?

272
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,756
 Of course, the halachic answer is clear. 

273
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:36,295
 Yamim kedoshim are workless days, yamim kevu'im are workdays, 

274
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,463
 yet one asks, 

275
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,466
what is the root of this distinction?

276
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:49,608
Apparently, there's a different experience
related to yamim kedoshim than the

277
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:55,814
experience which is associated with yamim

278
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,016
kevu'im like Chanukah and Purim.

279
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,954
The answer that yamim kedoshim
are all mi'd'Oraisa, of Biblical

280
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:07,359
origin, and yamim kevu'im are of
Rabbinical origin, I mean, it would

281
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,728
not -- simply, it would not satisfy us.

282
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,466
Let me give you

283
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,969
the answer in one sentence and
then I'll elaborate this sentence.

284
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,171
That's exactly what the

285
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,441
paper is out to accomplish.

286
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,743
The answer, I believe, is as follows.

287
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:31,450
The idea of yamim kedoshim or the
charisma of yamim kedoshim, expresses

288
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:39,624
itself in human -- what
shall I say -- introspection

289
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,393
 or withdrawal. 

290
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:51,036
The experience of yamim kedoshim -- of
yamim kevu'im manifests itself in human

291
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:55,574
openness and to outer directedness.

292
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,809
I'll elaborate that.

293
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,912
Let me explain it.

294
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:07,252
Wherever the Torah spoke of Shabbos,
not only of Shabbos, of the three

295
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:13,925
holidays as well, when we -- Gimmel
Regalim, Rosh Hashanah, Purim and -- Rosh

296
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,162
Hashanah, I mean, Pesach, Shavuos and the

297
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,297
Regalim, as well as Rosh Hashanah.

298
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,235
Wherever the Torah spoke of
Shabbos, of all the holidays,

299
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:33,445
it never failed to mention that the
day, the charismatic, the holy day, not

300
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:42,254
holiday, but the holy day is related and
dedicated to the law, to the Almighty.

301
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,725
"V'yom ha'shevi'i Shabbat 
la'Adoshem Elokecha."

302
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:51,930
"Sheshes yamim taavod v'asisa kol
melach'techa. V'yom ha'shevi'i Shabbos

303
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:59,771
la'Adoshem Elokecha." The seventh
day is a Shabbath unto the Lord.

304
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:06,445
"Chag ha'Sukkos taaseh lach", "Shivas
yamim tachog la'Adoshem Elokecha,"

305
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:13,385
a feast of Sukkot, you'll observe
the feast of Sukkot and you'll

306
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,321
celebrate seven days unto the Lord.

307
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:23,929
"Chag Shavuos taaseh la'Adoshem
Elokecha," the Feast of Weeks

308
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,698
you will celebrate unto the Lord.

309
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:28,800
What does it mean?

310
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,940
What does it mean, the
word la'Adoshem Elokecha?

311
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,142
What do the words

312
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,113
"The seventh day is a
Shabbath unto the Lord" mean?

313
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:46,985
What idea hides behind those strange,
enigmatic words 

314
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,622
"unto the Lord thy God"?

315
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:58,163
It would've been sufficient if He had
said, "Sheshes yamim taavod v'asisa kol

316
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,132
melachtecha. V'yom ha'shevi'i Shabbat." 

317
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,071
The idea would've been conveyed to us.

318
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:10,742
The six days you're allowed to work; and
the seventh day, we have to cease to work.

319
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,578
I believe that those

320
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:20,018
enigmatic words express an
exalted idea in Yahadus.

321
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:30,929
I would say it is the idea which was
mentioned by the Eitz HaChaim, the A"RI,

322
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:38,470
I mean, the founder of the Lurianic
School in mysticism and later developed

323
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:46,912
 and made the central idea of Chabad by the Tanya, by the founder of Chabad.

324
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,080
The idea, what

325
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:57,255
is known, whoever studied it, as
sod ha'tzimtzum, the mystery of

326
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:03,862
self-contraction or the mystery
of self-limitation or the mystery

327
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:10,335
of self-restriction or the
mystery of withdrawal and retreat.

328
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,105
As a matter of fact,

329
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:20,111
this mystery has accumulated also
the controversy between Chassidim and

330
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:26,785
Misnagdim, if we consider this controversy
from a philosophical viewpoint.

331
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,989
What is this mystery of tzimtzum say?

332
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,960
I mean, you know, let me
explain it in very simple terms.

333
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,900
The mystery of tzimtzum says
that creation of the world is a

334
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,271
sacrificial act on the part 
of the Almighty, 

335
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,574
as if, kaviyachol, the

336
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,910
Almighty has brought a sacrifice.

337
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:59,618
He gave something up when He
said, "Yehi ohr," let there be light

338
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:06,558
or by saying yehi ohr, the Almighty meant, let there be a world.

339
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:17,369
Before the universe came into existence,
God was one, His name was one.

340
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,139
By creating a world,

341
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:29,581
in general, and by creating
man, in particular, God

342
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:38,690
had surrendered His
aloneness, of being alone

343
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:46,431
and His loneliness, again, of
being alone, to the world.

344
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:52,203
In order to create the world,
He allowed finiteness, in

345
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,772
this case, a physical world,

346
00:27:53,772 --> 00:28:02,280
a physical universe to share in His
infinite being, in His infinite existence.

347
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,649
He allowed

348
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,686
somebody else, or something else,

349
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:17,228
to share with Him in what was exclusively

350
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,165
His own.

351
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:28,173
Prior to creation, where there was
only one infinite, all-inclusive

352
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,608
and all-encompassing, and

353
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:38,383
all-embracing existence, God,
there was nothing beside Him.

354
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:47,459
God did, kaviyachol, to withdraw and
to contract Himself in order to permit

355
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:54,733
a world to be born out of nothingness.

356
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:07,712
Yetzira means an act of self-restricting
on the part of infinity

357
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,449
and permitting

358
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:16,287
finitude to exist beside infinity,  

359
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,225
something which is nonsensical

360
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,260
from the viewpoint of logic.

361
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,665
From the viewpoint of logic, you all know
that if you should take an infinite number

362
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,969
and you try to add a finite
number to the infinite number,

363
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,737
what will you get in sum total?

364
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,572
An infinite number.

365
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:39,944
So basically, the whole existence of the
world is an absurdity from one viewpoint.

366
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,214
It's nonsensical, we really don't exist.

367
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,684
But how can finitude
exist beside infinity?

368
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,653
It's mathematically wrong.

369
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,288
It's logically wrong.

370
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:57,295
And this absurdity
is responsible for our existence,

371
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,430
that the world came into existence.

372
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,500
This is the great mystery of tzimtzum.

373
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,937
I cannot develop it, I mean,
fully, in accordance with the

374
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:16,047
Lurianic doctrine, which was developed,
I mean, later by the founder of Chabad.

375
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,283
It is true 

376
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:25,323
that in particular,
the creation of man in God's

377
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:31,095
image was a sacrificial act on
the part of Hakadosh Baruch Hu.

378
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:36,067
The mere fact that He endowed
man with imago dei, with the

379
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:42,941
image -- with His image, this itself
already an act of giving up  

380
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,679
because there is somebody 
who is divine.

381
00:30:49,981 --> 00:31:00,158
And He endowed man not only with the
image, but He endowed both with great

382
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:04,128
talents, with extraordinary capabilities.

383
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,366
These numerous skills

384
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:17,775
got bestowed upon him, honor and
glory which belong exclusively to God.

385
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:22,347
It's very interesting, Chassidim
do it every Shabbos, but in my

386
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,681
opinion, it is more impressive,

387
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,086
the custom of Misnagdim
is far more impressive.

388
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,488
We say it only once a year.

389
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,191
What I'm referring to?

390
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:39,364
"Haadares v'ha'emunah l'chai olamim.
Ha'binah v'ha'brachah l'chai olamim.

391
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:45,770
Ha'hod v'he'hadar l'chai olamim." With all those attributes, actually

392
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:53,211
belong -- still belong exclusively to
God, but God, in His generosity, has

393
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,647
bestowed some of the attributes on man.

394
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:01,085
Man is productive.

395
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,655
Indeed, he's a creative being.

396
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:10,128
God allowed man to consider himself
master and lord of his environment.

397
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,934
"Kol shatah tachas raglav," He
put everything under his feet.

398
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,871
God was generous with man.

399
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:27,845
He even urged man to explore the
universe, "Urdu ba'aretz v'chivshu'ha,"

400
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:33,818
and He advised him to reach out,
even for the boundless and the

401
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,454
fantastic, even for that which

402
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,956
is unreachable.

403
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:47,131
And man, regretfully, many times,
is mistaken and he actually looks

404
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:53,037
upon himself as if he were a
creator, as if he indeed owned

405
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,908
everything, himself and the world.

406
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,581
What do you call in

407
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,217
Kabbalah the nachash ha'kadmoni?

408
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,555
The serpent of old or the ancient serpent.

409
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:19,063
The ancient serpent of Genesis
suggested to man that he may conquer

410
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:24,102
the world and crown himself as God.

411
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,172
God tolerates it.

412
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:36,814
God does not take away man's skills, man's
talents, man's capabilities, even though

413
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:44,622
from time to time, man misuses them and
becomes arrogant and also very foolish.

414
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,627
On the Shabbat, 

415
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:57,735
and on every yom
gadol v'kadosh, when a great day

416
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,203
when a holy day

417
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,705
arrives,

418
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:05,343
 man is called upon to seize, not to rest. 

419
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,413
Rest is the result, but he's

420
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,681
called upon to seize.

421
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,519
What should he seize?

422
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:14,986
What?

423
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,254
What activity?

424
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,790
What activity should he seize?

425
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,394
To play the role of master and lord, 

426
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,734
to acknowledge that he 
possesses nothing,

427
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,904
owns nothing, masters nothing  

428
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,741
and he is nothing.

429
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,146
That he's not in control,

430
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:49,087
certainly, that he's neither in control
of the world, nor is he in control of himself.

431
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,791
Or of his own talents and skills.

432
00:34:55,693 --> 00:35:02,400
Yom kadosh is not so much
a day of rest, of menuchah.

433
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:10,775
It is mainly a day of shevisa, of
stopping discontinuing.

434
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,411
Give it up.

435
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,446
And while menuchah

436
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:21,452
denotes rest, shevisa has the connotation
of leaving off, of discontinuing,

437
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,423
something which one is accustomed to.

438
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,226
But what is this something?

439
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,560
What is this something?

440
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,865
Mainly this is avodah, this is work.

441
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,233
Why?

442
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:44,909
Why was work chosen as the means of
man's humbling himself and admitting

443
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,144
the truth 

444
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:53,151
and, sad to say, and
pleading guilty of arrogance, of

445
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:59,357
false pretenses, of an
overexaggerated notion of himself?

446
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:04,028
Why was work chosen by the

447
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:09,333
Torah as the symbol of that
basic change in man which

448
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,003
should take place on a 
yom gadol v'kadosh?

449
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,005
For two reasons.

450
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,142
Work, basically, is important

451
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,443
for two reasons.

452
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:25,082
Work is the source of
human power and glory.

453
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:31,622
No other creature is basically a
working being, a working creature.

454
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,294
No other creature is capable
of constructing work.

455
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:42,800
If the animal, sometimes, is busy,
but whatever the animal does is

456
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,869
not work in a philosophical sense.

457
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,839
It is pushed by some mechanical instinct.

458
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,676
There is no intention,
there is no plan and

459
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,844
there is no productivity to it.

460
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,648
[audio gap] -- the animal doesn't produce.

461
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,552
It certainly, there is no creativity.

462
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,487
An animal doesn't create.

463
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:12,496
Only man is a working being and
understands like that, a productive

464
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,900
being, and through work and

465
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,172
only through work, man
manifests his unlimited power.

466
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:28,379
"Va'techasreihu m'at mei'Elokim," he's
just a little bit below the angels.

467
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,952
The reason is because man
has a capacity for work.

468
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:43,027
Or when, for instance, in Greek mythology
and it spilled over into Greek philosophy,

469
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:53,204
into Plato's Ideal Republic, considered
work as a degrading occupation for man.

470
00:37:54,138 --> 00:38:00,444
On the contrary, they always dreamt
of the golden age, or an existence

471
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,214
which would not require the work of man

472
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:09,053
because work which was good for
slaves -- don't forget the Greeks

473
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:13,591
had a slave society, but for
the free man, for the Hellen,

474
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:20,831
for the aristocracies, work is degrading.

475
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,500
It's below their dignity.

476
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,409
Yahadus came out, first of all, that
work is dignifying, redeeming, cleansing.

477
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,977
Who works?

478
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,513
Even, kaviyachol, God.

479
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,582
"Mi'kol melach'to asher asah."

480
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:45,823
And if man wants to reach dignity,
greatness, sweep, and depth, there is

481
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,993
only one means which he can employ.

482
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,696
This is work.

483
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,700
Work, there's another aspect to work.

484
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:03,808
Work is the cohesive force which
unites individuals into a group,

485
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,410
sociologically very important.

486
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:20,958
Work is the most potent factor which pulls
man out of his hideout, of his hiding, and

487
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:26,030
merges individuals into communities.

488
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,533
And it's a simple reason here.

489
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,235
Everybody knows it.

490
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:39,110
One cannot acquire all skills which
are indispensable for the gratification

491
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,013
of man's needs.

492
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,715
And therefore,

493
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:51,589
one must exchange services
with his contemporaries.

494
00:39:53,023 --> 00:40:00,164
The exchange of services brings about
interdependence and interaction which,

495
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:06,437
in turn, leads to fraternization or

496
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,141
to the coalescence of
individuals into one entity.

497
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,910
Call it community, call it
society, call it state, I mean,

498
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,645
the name is completely irrelevant.

499
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:22,887
The constant trading and exchanging
interweaves the individual into

500
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:31,095
community and the isolated "I" into
the texture of a together existence or

501
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,997
an existence in community.

502
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:44,875
In short, the role which work plays
in promoting a together existence or

503
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,711
a community existence is tremendous.

504
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:56,020
If people didn't have to work,
if people didn't work, they would

505
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,057
never form a community or a state.

506
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,759
They would never coalesce

507
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:08,098
and unite into groups because each
individual would feel happy in his

508
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:13,904
isolation and in his place of hiding.

509
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:20,544
There wouldn't have been, I mean,
this magnetic force which pulls the

510
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,481
individual toward the community.

511
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:28,052
As a matter of fact, here, Yahadus,
again, is in conflict with the

512
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,187
philosophy of the Age of Reason.

513
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:35,493
Philosophy of the Age of Reason
adored the individual, did not

514
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:41,932
understand the community, for in
explaining the community, they had

515
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,970
to introduce a new concept like
the social contract which is very

516
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,005
artificial and very synthetic over here.

517
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,243
Because to Rousseau and
Montesquieu, Voltaire,

518
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,844
I mean, all the philosophers of

519
00:41:55,379 --> 00:42:01,485
the Age of Reason, I mean,
there was basically the

520
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,988
individual is the great being.

521
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,459
Not the communities.

522
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,863
That's why such a story -- the
story of Robinson Crusoe was

523
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,433
born during the Age of Reason.

524
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,703
It couldn't have been born now.

525
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:34,251
with Marxism rampant and communism,
I mean, expanding quickly because

526
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:39,089
in Marxism, the individual means
nothing, the community reigns supreme.

527
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:47,464
Yahadus has never agreed with this
theory that the individual can get along

528
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,967
all by himself, alone on an island.

529
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:55,339
Yahadus was of the opinion that lonely man

530
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:01,779
cannot meet the task that
has been assigned to him by

531
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,547
his creator.

532
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,719
What task has been assigned
to man by his creator?

533
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:15,359
"L'avdah u'l'shamrah," to dress and
to keep, to work and to cultivate.

534
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:21,899
Working man, this man cannot 
afford to be idle,

535
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,871
but he's got to be a working
being, so he needs a helper.

536
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,209
"Lo tov heyos ha'adam levado
e'eseh lo eizer kenegdo," it's

537
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,346
not good for him to be alone, I
shall make a helper opposite him.

538
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:42,353
In short, working man is always what

539
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:46,724
we call it in halachic
literature a reshus ha'rabim.

540
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:52,896
He's on the highway, manufacturing,
trading, exchanging goods and

541
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:59,169
services, talking, arguing, fighting,
helping, but always with somebody.

542
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:06,176
No wonder that Chava was created the
very instant Adam was charged with

543
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,979
the task of l'avdah u'l'shamrah.

544
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,816
He was placed in the Garden of Eden,
charged with the task of l'avdah

545
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:19,323
u'l'shamrah, to be a working being and
also, I mean -- and as a working being,

546
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,992
he needed help, so Eve was created.

547
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,230
No wonder I see it every day.

548
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:31,201
Perhaps that's the reason that I'm
still active, that people retire

549
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:37,608
from business or from profession,
find out and quite quickly, very

550
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:45,816
fast, that they are unneeded, lonely,
and that society abandoned them,

551
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,685
including their own children.

552
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,321
And that the world passes them by.

553
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,028
Because if a man stops working,
there is no need for him to

554
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,899
maintain communication lines with
the community, with the society.

555
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,767
Somehow, he expels himself.

556
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,003
Instantly he expels himself.

557
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,139
He excludes himself from
the working community.

558
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,343
If there is no work, there
are no responsibilities.

559
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:20,784
The communal ties, little by
little, disappear, are broken.

560
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:27,825
And on the Shabbat, God
told man to stop working.

561
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,894
What did He want to achieve by that?

562
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:37,301
What was God out to achieve by
telling man to stop working?

563
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:47,010
He told man to cease to work, to
leave up in the middle, retreat

564
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,046
and rest.

565
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:55,753
In other words, man is supposed -- but
I want you not to misunderstand me --

566
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,022
on Shabbos, to leave society.

567
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:08,665
Man retreats while using a bigger
term from the thou existence -- it

568
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,434
means I am thou existence

569
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,804
-- into an I existence, I existence.

570
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,307
He retreats on the Shabbat -- this
is the experience of the Shabbat

571
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,377
-- into privacy and aloneness.

572
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:27,918
On the Shabbat, the individual
gains supremacy over

573
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,253
the community.

574
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:37,861
He withdraws from conquest and
acquisition, from work, and if he

575
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:43,967
withdraws from conquest and acquisition
and work, then he also withdraws

576
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:49,339
from his coworkers and 
partners and associates 

577
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,913
into the mysterious abode

578
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,383
of an I, of a lonely I existence.

579
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:05,589
It's quite remarkable that, in
Beshalach, when Moses revealed on

580
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,793
behalf of the Almighty the mystery of
Shabbos to the people, so the slogan

581
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,197
of Shabbos then became "Al yeitzei"

582
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,933
-- "Sh'vu tach'techem," sit

583
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:23,440
-- stay in your places, "al yeitzei ish
mimkomo ba'yom ha'shevi'i," no man go

584
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,743
out of his place on the seventh day.

585
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,512
No fraternization.

586
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:37,821
No unitedness, I would
say, no coalescence.

587
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,457
Man is alone.

588
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,763
And he should experience 
himself as a being alone.

589
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:52,269
On the Shabbat, God
tolerates no competition.

590
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:58,075
He does not want to share man
with anybody else, with society.

591
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:02,646
Hence, He told man, retreat from society.

592
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:08,252
The latter has no claims on him -- "V'yom ha'shevi'i" -- now

593
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,519
we understand the words.

594
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,924
"V'yom ha'shevi'i Shabbat la'Adoshem
Elokecha," the seventh day

595
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,093
is up to the Lord.

596
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,530
The seventh day is the
Shabbat unto thy God.

597
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,633
Everything belongs to Him.

598
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:27,537
Cease to be a slave to thy work,
discontinue being a servant to

599
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,674
society, be exclusively mine.

600
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:35,512
On Shabbat, the idea of
Shabbat is man's aloneness.

601
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:41,285
If man is alone, he's also with God.

602
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:51,428
The kedushat ha'Shabbat, the charisma
of Shabbos, expresses itself in the

603
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,932
returning of man to God and to himself.

604
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,804
In the severance of the individual from

605
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:09,379
the working society, that act
of severing hallows the day and

606
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,049
renders it a yom gadol v'kadosh.

607
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:19,856
Separation from society is ipso facto
liberating, liberation from society.

608
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:30,267
Man terminates his transient relations
with his fellow man and establishes

609
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:34,838
another relation, which is
permanent communion with God.

610
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,575
Don't ask me

611
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,110
any questions about it.

612
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,813
Of course, people do a lot of 
visiting on Shabbos.

613
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:58,095
And the impression which is conveyed as if
Shabbos were a day of socializing, of

614
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:02,866
fraternizing, of being together, 
it's not true.

615
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:09,639
And perhaps, I'll explain to you
later in what -- there's only

616
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,341
one exception to the rule, which

617
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:16,880
the Torah made, of man being alone on
Shabbos and -- that's as far as 

618
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,984
study is concerned.

619
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,655
If I have time, I'll explain it.

620
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,923
However, let's continue.

621
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:31,561
However, Judaism thought -- here
we come to the dialectical

622
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,398
nature of Judaica approach.

623
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:40,504
However, Judaism thought highly
of existence in community as well.

624
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:47,411
God is not only the father of the
individuals, "Elokei Avraham Elokei

625
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:53,316
Yitzchak v'Elokei Yaakov," but
of the community, as an entity.

626
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,252
He's "Elokei Yisrael" as well.

627
00:50:56,853 --> 00:51:04,294
Judaism's approach to
the millennial problem,

628
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:08,098
which came up in the pre-Socratic
Greek philosophy, the

629
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,435
problem of individual versus community.

630
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:16,807
Let me use a Talmudic phrase, "Hei
minayhu adif," which is preferred,

631
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,209
an individual existence or

632
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,078
a communal existence?

633
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:29,519
The approach of Judaism was one of
dialectics, the dialectical approach.

634
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,756
Namely, Judaism has accepted, as

635
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:38,795
in many other cases, accepted the
thesis as well as the antithesis.

636
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,466
Judaism says

637
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,734
as follows about this problem.

638
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:51,541
On the one hand, if man is completely
united with the community, wholly

639
00:51:51,541 --> 00:52:00,283
in reshus ha'rabim, immersed
in the concerns of the many

640
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:06,690
and not paying attention to
his own needs or to himself.

641
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,893
I don't mean in a selfish,
in an egotistic manner.

642
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:19,436
He's liable to lose his very power,
his very humanity, his original

643
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:26,276
trust and sensitivity, the fantastic
resources of human creativity.

644
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:33,783
Ah, and man communed about it to be found
not in public man but in private man.

645
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:42,359
Not in man's communion with
others but in man's communion

646
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,361
with himself.

647
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:50,200
The greatness, the genius in man is to
be discovered in the monologue, not in

648
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,004
the dialogue between the I and the thou.

649
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,439
The greatness is found

650
00:52:56,439 --> 00:53:00,343
in soliloquy, not in chitchat.

651
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:08,685
In his loneliness awareness and sense
of singleness, being single -- 

652
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,520
I don't mean single and not married.

653
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,523
I mean single that no one else is like me.

654
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,724
This is basic.

655
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,795
Chazal developed it, k'shem
sh'partzufeihem meshunos

656
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,130
kach daasei'hem meshunos.

657
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,298
Chazal did

658
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,768
not believe in doubles as far
as the countenance is concerned,

659
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,403
as the face is concerned.

660
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:33,143
They also believe that each
individual is a freak, spiritually.

661
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:38,715
He has his own unique approach,
his own unique outlook on life,

662
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,550
his own unique philosophy.

663
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,220
If two people agree, it's
because they comprise.

664
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,087
They give up.

665
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:55,398
Because if man were stubborn and truthful,
truthful to himself, there would be a

666
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,568
bellum omnes contra omnes, is upset.

667
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,737
The war of everybody against everybody.

668
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:10,847
There is an element of sheker, of
untruth, in human agreement, in

669
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,916
agreement with two individuals.

670
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:20,924
Of course, this means carrying the
theory of individualism into an

671
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:27,731
extreme, but I'm convinced that the
greatness of man is to be found in

672
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,201
reshus ha'yachid, in the four cubits

673
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:36,072
of his individualistic lonely existence.

674
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:46,950
The corporate state, the socialist or
communist society, tries hard to level

675
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,253
off the distinctiveness of individuality.

676
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:56,393
By so trying, the Marxist or
communist society destroys the very

677
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,329
sensitivity and creativity of man.

678
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,897
It's a fact.

679
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:04,901
For instance, Russia was
famous for its literature.

680
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,238
Russian literature, actually,
in the 19th century,

681
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:15,779
perhaps was the most profound
and the most sensitive literature.

682
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,951
It transcended the French
and certainly the Germans, as

683
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:24,421
far as the novel is concerned.

684
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,522
I'm not speaking about poetry.

685
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,259
As far as the novel is
concerned, it dried up.

686
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,761
This literature dried

687
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,298
up with the advent of communism in Russia.

688
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:38,568
And don't tell me because
the Russians don't allow.

689
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:45,442
Even the books which were printed,
I mean published abroad, outside of

690
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:49,579
Russia, are not great artistic works.

691
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,815
I mean, one got a Nobel Prize for it.

692
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,651
It was purely for political reasons.

693
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,619
The Kremlin was right as

694
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,188
far as the Nobel Prize

695
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,622
was concerned.

696
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:04,260
Couldn't compare that with
Dostoevsky, Tolstoy or Turgenev.

697
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,962
I mean, you couldn't compare it.

698
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,931
There's no sweep, there

699
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,132
is no depth to it.

700
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:13,536
It lacks the mysterious quality,
I mean, which Russian literature

701
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:18,408
had, because the corporate state
cannot produce sensitive souls.

702
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:23,179
Of course, you pay the toll of
the road, the artist is the first

703
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,781
one to pay the toll of the road.

704
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:30,019
Then comes the scientists, but the
artist, in a corporate state pays

705
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:34,424
the toll of the road, not because
the state is not liberal enough.

706
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:38,962
Simply, the resources
of creativity dry up.

707
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:41,197
They are

708
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,934
to be found only in an individual
who rebels against society, an

709
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:49,739
individual who has the guts to
say to society what he thinks.

710
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:55,111
The individual who is introspective, the
individual who tries to find out who he is.

711
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:01,785
And thinks the mere question,
who am I, is forbidden in Russia,

712
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:07,190
it's heresy, so if you don't answer
the question, who am I, so there

713
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,025
is no need for literature.

714
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:14,330
The literature is concerned
with one question.

715
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:21,471
Since Homer and what shall I say -- is

716
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:27,343
about what the human being is, who he
is and particularly who am I and what do

717
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,279
I stand for.

718
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,448
Yahadus

719
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,285
encouraged man

720
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,460
to rebel quite often against
society, to act like an individual

721
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,229
and to be different and unique.

722
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:54,471
No one who didn't study halachah
properly has any idea -- can imagine

723
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:59,042
how much freedom the halachic
scholar has in interpreting halachah,

724
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:04,881
in so-called chiddushim, in being
creative in the halachic field.

725
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,283
I mean, Yahadus has encroached.

726
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:12,355
I mean, the famous story of Rabbi
Eliezer, he was in controversy with

727
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:18,294
his colleagues and they stood up
and they counted and accepted, I

728
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,897
mean, the opinion of the majority.

729
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:28,671
And then, I mean, there was intervention
even on part of the Almighty

730
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,473
in favor Rabbi Eliezer and they

731
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,408
did not accept this intervention.

732
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,678
It shows how much freedom
the halachic scholar has.

733
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,549
Of course, if he's a
scholar, I want you to know.

734
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:45,421
Those who claim freedom and say the
halachah is not free are not scholars.

735
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,756
This is the trouble, you see.

736
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,426
But a scholar enjoys unlimited freedom

737
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:59,135
because the individual is the creative
agent in halachah, as well in many

738
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:03,573
other fields, and that's why you
cannot limit his freedom, I mean,

739
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:11,848
his authority to express opinions,
I mean, the way he understands.

740
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:18,888
God created just one man, Adam.

741
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:25,028
He concluded his covenant just
with one individual, Abraham.

742
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:30,533
The first redeemer was a lonely individual, Moses,

743
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,368
 and very strange.

744
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:37,373
And while the Tablets, given to the
entire community the first time,

745
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,876
were quickly shattered,

746
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:45,448
the Second Luchot, the 
Second Tablets, entrusted 

747
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:49,886
to Moses alone, as an individual,

748
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,057
"V'ish al yeira b'chol ha'har ha'hu,"

749
00:59:54,057 --> 01:00:01,564
no one could accompany Moses up
the mount, are still existent and

750
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,834
they still are committed to them.

751
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:09,939
That means Yahadus understood
very well the greatness of the

752
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:14,944
individual, and in order to be
creative, he should not be completely

753
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,681
immersed in society.

754
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:27,790
On the other hand, Yahadus said
complete immersion in oneself leads

755
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,792
to serious emotional problems.

756
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,329
I'm not a psychiatrist, so I can't tell
you what kind of problems there are.

757
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,598
I know just there are problems.

758
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:44,307
And egocentricity is not only amoral
but also a personalistic anomaly,

759
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:51,948
and that's why to say the individual
reigns supreme is impossible.

760
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,216
This was

761
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:54,150
the thesis.

762
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,586
Now, I'm trying to develop the antithesis.

763
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:04,360
Moreover, the basic virtues which
are at the apex of our ethical

764
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,731
hierarchy, like compassion, love, 

765
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:18,975
I mean, sharing in one's travail
and distress, those basic

766
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:26,482
virtues, they're right from the
midas ha'chessed, from chessed, and

767
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:32,522
they lose their significance should
the individual live in isolation.

768
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:38,094
Robinson Crusoe could
not practice compassion.

769
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:41,964
He had no one to sympathize with.

770
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,866
He could not love anybody.

771
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,736
He could love only one person, himself.

772
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:55,912
How can the individual who withdrew
from society experience compassion

773
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,681
and love for his fellow man?

774
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,784
How can the individual love his fellow man

775
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:05,154
if he's emotionally remote from him?

776
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,326
And such an individual is
portrayed in the Bible.

777
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,360
Where?

778
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:20,103
One individual was punished and then
he learned how to live in community.

779
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,973
He was restored to his own
glory -- to his previous glory.

780
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:24,774
Who?

781
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:25,942
(audience member) Aharon.

782
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:26,909
No.

783
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,677
(audience member) Yonah.

784
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:28,978
No, no, Yonah, no.

785
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,546
Job.

786
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,682
Just a minute.

787
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:36,619
What kind of a fellow was Job?

788
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,988
Chazal were never sure about him.

789
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,957
He's a very elusive character, Job.

790
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,492
Chazal were not too sure.

791
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,128
They didn't even know when
he existed, when he lived.

792
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,331
One said he lived during the time
of Abraham, another one said during

793
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:53,002
the time of Moses, another one said
he lived during the time of David,

794
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:57,707
the fourth one said he lived during
the time of Mordechai v'Esther.

795
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:03,012
Anyway, I don't know when he lived,
but he didn't leave any marks.

796
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,915
He disappeared tracelessly,

797
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,087
Job, and he did not -- when
Abraham was engaged in a struggle.

798
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:15,091
Chazal speak about Abraham as the lonely
person, the whole world on one side of

799
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,593
the river and he on the other 
side of the river.

800
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:21,330
It's quite characteristic
of Yisrael now, yeah.

801
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,601
But anyway, Abraham could use,
I mean, the help and assistance

802
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,603
of such a powerful man as Job.

803
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:30,740
Did Job help him?

804
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,941
No, not at all.

805
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,544
He was not concerned.

806
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,280
The same, Moses could've used him, too.

807
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,983
According to one interpretation, he was
a member of the inner council of the

808
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,487
chicken cabinet -- of the kitchen cabinet.

809
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,592
Of the kitchen cabinet.

810
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,395
It's either chicken cabinet
or kitchen cabinet, what?

811
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:59,969
Of that conferring cabinet,
you see, which has decided the

812
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,004
destiny of the Jew in Mitzrayim.

813
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,774
"Kol ha'ben ha'yilod
ha'ye'orah tashlichuhu." What

814
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:05,675
he did?

815
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,111
Balaam was educated -- I mean,
he had recommended "Kol ha'ben

816
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:11,347
ha'ye'orah tashlichuhu."

817
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,050
Yisro opposed this opinion.

818
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,585
It's a little too primitive.

819
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,687
It's primitive, you don't do such things.

820
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,188
You don't murder people.

821
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:24,293
At least Yisro had a more sensitive
conscious than the statesmen of today.

822
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:29,065
You let murderers who kill 35, 36
people, I mean, go free, I mean.

823
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:33,135
It has never happened in -- not
in our history, but in the

824
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,937
history of the world, yes.

825
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,274
And what did Iyov do?

826
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:41,644
Job? Shatak, kept quiet.

827
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,246
Right.

828
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:47,383
Then, he was bimei Mordechai
v'Esther b'Shushan Ha'Birah.

829
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:52,088
He could have protested against such
an edict that was issued by Haman.

830
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,590
"Laharog u'l'abed es kol
ha'Yehudim mi'naar v'ad zaken taf

831
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,260
v'nashim b'yom echad b'shloshah
asar l'Chodesh Adar." Why?

832
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,261
For what?

833
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,262
Did he protest?

834
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,296
No.

835
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,499
He was an individualist.

836
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,767
What did he do?

837
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,069
With what was he concerned?

838
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,005
How did he spend his life?

839
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,840
What troubled his mind?

840
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:12,475
Whom did he love?

841
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,944
He loved somebody; himself and his family.

842
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:21,951
And the pasuk tells us in
the most beautiful manner.

843
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:23,452
"And it

844
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,390
was so, when the days of their
feasting were gone every week,

845
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:35,531
that Job sent and sanctified them,
and rose up early in the morning,

846
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:42,271
and offered burning-offerings
according to the number of them all."

847
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:43,940
It means he did seven.

848
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,409
Beyond the Number 7,

849
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,544
no one else existed for Job.

850
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:54,483
A Jewish people didn't exist.

851
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,618
He forgot about it.

852
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:01,924
That's why he met with disaster.

853
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:07,663
It is quite characteristic that when
God rewarded Job and gave him everything

854
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:12,468
back, He stipulated one condition.

855
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,972
Job will find everything he lost.

856
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:22,545
In fact, he will get twice as much,
provided he will do just one thing.

857
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:27,850
Bildad Ha'Shuchi and Elifaz Ha'Teimani
and Tzofar Ha'Naamasi were in trouble

858
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,853
because they did not handle Job properly.

859
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:37,259
And God said that you forgive their
sins provided Job will pray for them.

860
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:41,063
But Job has never prayed for anyone
else but for himself and his children.

861
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:43,132
How can Job pray for somebody else?

862
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,067
Or he could perhaps come to
shul on Shabbos and make a 

863
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:49,472
Mi Sh'beirach, like we do sometimes.

864
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,140
Yeah, but a Mi Sh'beirach

865
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,375
was not enough.

866
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:59,048
And God said, "L'hispallel baadchem,"
He meant real tefillah, genuine

867
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,284
prayer, genuine intersession,

868
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,389
but this was a condition Sine qua non.

869
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:12,294
And apparently, Job rose to great
heights after he met with disaster and

870
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:18,534
he found in himself enough love and
enough concern for others and enough

871
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:22,938
dedication that he indeed prayed for them.

872
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:26,308
And the pasuk tells us -- and this
is the whole moral of the Book of

873
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:31,847
Job -- "And the Lord changed the
fortune of Job, when he prayed for

874
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:37,219
his friends; and the Lord
gave Job twice as much."

875
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,225
A single existence is
quite often very dangerous.

876
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:46,562
It may lead to the disaster of Job.

877
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:52,301
It led to disaster, the single
existence of the American Jewish

878
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:55,004
community, during the Holocaust period.

879
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,640
We are all so concerned with ourselves.

880
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,545
We are not concerned with the world,
certainly not with our brethren

881
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:08,317
and our fellow Jews, and we let
millions of Jews go down the drain.

882
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:15,758
Somebody told me, and he's right, that to
the least of Al Cheits, of the chata'im

883
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:20,729
we enumerate on Yom Kippur, we should
add another Al Cheit, and perhaps it'd

884
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,199
be the worst, the most horrible one.

885
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:31,107
Al cheit sh'chatanu lefanecha
b'ra'inu tzaros nafshoseihem shel

886
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,678
acheinu Beis Yisrael sh'his'chanen

887
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,514
aleinu v'lo shamanu.

888
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:45,187
I raised the question
because -- I don't want to say it.

889
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:50,192
I'm afraid we are about to
confront the world again.

890
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,161
Not

891
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,030
-- you know what I mean.

892
01:08:56,332 --> 01:09:01,637
We're isolated, completely alone,
the whole world is against us, be

893
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:08,644
it because of the shortage of oil,
be it because man is unreliable,

894
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,746
"Kol ha'adam kozev." I don't know.

895
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:14,016
Frankly I can't understand, I mean,
the leaders of the world today

896
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,186
and they are going to sell out.

897
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:17,987
I'm afraid so.

898
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:22,825
I'm not an alarmist by nature, but if
they are going to sell out, it will be a

899
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,127
problem for the American Jews how to act.

900
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,696
And I don't recommend
any course of action.

901
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:30,900
I don't know yet what's going to happen,
but I believe that every American

902
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:36,138
Jew should have this possibility
in mind, how we'll act like Job

903
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,875
before he met with disaster.

904
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,112
We are safe here.

905
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:46,415
Of course, as far as human
beings are concerned, you can

906
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,884
never stay safe in absolute

907
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:55,457
terms, you understand, but
shall we or will we support?

908
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:59,195
I mean, I don't mean support to give some
money, but more than that is involved.

909
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,329
I don't know.

910
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:00,763
I don't know.

911
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:01,564
I don't advise.

912
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:02,331
I don't suggest.

913
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:06,468
I don't give -- I am just
reminding you this is the problem.

914
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:13,275
Hence, Judaism, on the one hand,

915
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:22,484
understood the greatness of the
existential experience of man alone.

916
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,822
It's important to be an individual.

917
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:30,359
As I told you, man is creative because
he is an individual, because he's

918
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:33,095
different, because he can't be alone.

919
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:41,904
He can live in the recesses of his
personality, unknown to others and on

920
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:46,742
the other hand, Judaism also understood
the greatness of the community of the

921
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:51,447
existential experience of living in
the community or with the community.

922
01:10:53,249 --> 01:11:00,222
And Yahadus said the thesis
plus the antithesis are correct.

923
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:07,162
Individual -- the Jew must be capable
of being alone and at the same time

924
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:12,901
being together, of withdrawing from
society, escaping from society, from

925
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,205
the noise of the street, from the
vulgarity, from the coarseness of

926
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:23,279
society, from the artificiality of
society and also must be capable to

927
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:29,118
come back and join society and merge
with society and be one with society.

928
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:34,423
The Jew should experience existence

929
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:42,197
as a "together" affair, as
well as an only "I" affair.

930
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:49,872
And the Jew should now the art of
being concerned only with himself

931
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:54,276
and also to say -- in the same
time of being concerned with all,

932
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,578
with the community.

933
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:02,584
The individual is both, a separated
existential entity who cannot

934
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,787
imagine existence outside of himself.

935
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:09,258
Let me be -- you know, when man
gets older, he begins to think

936
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,762
in very strange, peculiar terms.

937
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,598
I can imagine many things.

938
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:21,036
I cannot imagine one thing and
this is because I am an individual.

939
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:28,177
What world -- how is it possible for
the world -- will it be possible

940
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,747
for the world to go on existing
after I'll be gone?

941
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,148
I cannot imagine that.

942
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:35,851
I cannot imagine it.

943
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:41,056
There is a short story written by
a master writer, Peter Altenberg.

944
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,758
He was a Jew, assimilated Jew.

945
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,693
He was at the turn of the century.

946
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:49,331
He fought against Herzl because
Herzl also lived in Vienna.

947
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,867
He was the correspondent -- the
Parisian correspondent for the

948
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,437
Allgemeine Freie Presse, yeah.

949
01:12:55,437 --> 01:13:02,077
So there is a short story, a
short story written by Altenberg.

950
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:06,515
It's called New Year, 1951, or '41.

951
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:10,018
Anyway, so he describes a New Year Eve.

952
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:15,190
The streets are blanketed with
snow and everybody is rushing and

953
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:20,963
He gives a -- he was a very sensitive
man, and he gives a portrayal

954
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,365
of New Year's Eve, as a Viennese, I mean.

955
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,734
You have to be in Vienna now
to understand what it means.

956
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:26,635
 You understand.

957
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:32,040
As a Viennese, all the dances and the Prosit Neujahr, I mean,

958
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,777
and the kissing each other and 
embracing each other.

959
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,779
 And then there is the last line.

960
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:46,855
"The same New Year's Eve as I celebrated in 1903, what is the difference?

961
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,557
There's one difference only.

962
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:54,096
Peter Altenberg will not be around in 1951, on New Year's."

963
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,299
It means he couldn't imagine
how could a New Year's Eve take place

964
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:58,500
without him.

965
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:04,306
And this is typical, I mean, at
least, I mean, of many individuals.

966
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,976
We don't think in such terms, but
from time to time, thoughts converge

967
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,546
upon us -- converge.

968
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:14,516
And I -- of course, I don't
think in terms of New Year's Eve.

969
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:18,587
I think in terms of -- I think New
Year's Eve is -- the experience of

970
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:22,424
New Year's Eve is not a part of my,

971
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,593
let's say, fond memories.

972
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,499
I was once beaten up on New Year's Eve.

973
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:36,305
In Germany, I mean, in Germany, in
Furth, Germany, a bier German met me,

974
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,775
"Prosit Neujahr," and he beat me up.

975
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,845
It was 1933 or '32.

976
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:47,349
Anyway, so what I think many times,
you know, when such thoughts come

977
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:53,522
up on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah,
I think of another Rosh Hashanah.

978
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,325
In the future.

979
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,828
And I see all this -- I see it in the beis
midrash and the same routine going through

980
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:04,666
their routine, na, na, na, and the chants
of the chazzan and the typical melodies,

981
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,770
"Halleluyah hallelu Kel b'kodsho,"
and there's, "Ha'Kel yeshuaseinu

982
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,139
v'ezraseinu selah," everything as it was.

983
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,209
But there's only one
difference; I won't be there.

984
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:18,680
And this is a tragic experience.

985
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,617
The individual cannot imagine
a world without him being

986
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,852
around, being a part of it.

987
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:28,023
And this is -- basically,
it's a tragic experience, but

988
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,158
it is a creative experience.

989
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,495
It’s an inspiring experience.

990
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,732
I can't explain it to you, but

991
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,902
it's inspiring and it is rooted in

992
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:47,509
the individuality and
exclusiveness of the human being.

993
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:55,918
And that's why when we recite Zichronot
on Rosh Hashanah, we speak, V'al

994
01:15:55,918 --> 01:16:02,324
hamedinos bo yei'omer yomer eizo la'charev
v'eizo la'raav u'vriyus bo yepakeidu.

995
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:07,629
The community, as well as the individual,
are judged by the Almighty.

996
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:13,335
He looks upon the single person as
a part of a collective as well as a

997
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:19,074
closed-up being, as an open being in
steady communion with the community -- 

998
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:24,813
I mean, with the society and on the other
hand as a closed-up being, separate,

999
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,651
abiding in the shadows of community.

1000
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:38,961
The same dialectical method, and I want
to emphasize it, is applicable to the

1001
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:44,566
relationship between the covenantal
community -- I mean, the Jew and humanity.

1002
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,935
What's our relationship to mankind?

1003
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,304
What's our relationship to mankind?

1004
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,772
Are we a part or aren't we a part

1005
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:51,974
of mankind?

1006
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,844
Antisemites now say no, the
Jew is not part of mankind.

1007
01:16:55,844 --> 01:17:02,250
This is the main trope, antisemitic
story now which has been circulating for

1008
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,486
a long -- for quite a number of years.

1009
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:06,121
The Jew is very clannish.

1010
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,889
He's only concerned with himself.

1011
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:08,690
Proof?

1012
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:10,492
When the war broke out on

1013
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:13,061
Yom Kippur, the Jewish community
raised a billion dollars in a few

1014
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:16,798
days, but did the Jew raise money for

1015
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:20,936
For Vietnam?

1016
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,872
Was the Jew concerned
with the war in Vietnam?

1017
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:30,579
Or was the Jew concerned with the
drought-stricken, I mean, Africa?

1018
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,614
He's clannish, he's selfish.

1019
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,548
Not as an individual.

1020
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:34,916
As a group, they are selfish.

1021
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,818
They are group-selfish.

1022
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,020
There is group selfishness.

1023
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:42,557
Let's ask ourselves, are
we a part or aren't we

1024
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:43,725
a part?

1025
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,195
We're a part of mankind because
all diseases which attack a

1026
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:50,265
non-Jew can attack the Jew as well.

1027
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:54,836
Yes, I mean, the same therapy, but
I mean experientially, spiritually;

1028
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,506
do we belong or don't we belong?

1029
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:05,313
I believe the answer lies in already
-- in the dialectical method we introduced

1030
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,349
with regard to the old controversy.

1031
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,452
What's the relationship between
the individual and community?

1032
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,856
The individual belongs to the
community and doesn't belong.

1033
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:20,328
He retreats, withdraws from the community
and then he joins the community.

1034
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:25,133
The same is true of the covenantal
community versus universal community.

1035
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,702
The covenantal community is also just

1036
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,238
an individual and individuality.

1037
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:39,915
We certainly share the concerns of
man, in general, because we face

1038
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:47,522
the same problems, such as disease,
famine, injustice, et cetera, but at

1039
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:53,228
the same time, we are also concerned
-- or we are concerned with ourselves.

1040
01:18:53,695 --> 01:19:05,173
We have interests and concerns of our
own and one is not supposed to drop our

1041
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:11,847
concerns, our individual concerns because
so many say that the Jew is egotistic.

1042
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:16,952
Again, we are part of humanity.

1043
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:22,324
At the same time, we
are alone for ourselves.

1044
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,499
Hence,

1045
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:40,642
Judaism has another method by
which it sets up a festival and

1046
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:47,449
by which it invests or it endows
this festival with meaningfulness.

1047
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:55,624
It paradoxically is the fact that
the yom kavuah -- they called

1048
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,259
Chanukah, Purim a yom kavuah.

1049
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,294
There was no kedushas hayom in those days, 

1050
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,063
but a yom kavuah, there is 
something specific,

1051
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:12,941
something unique, something singular
to the day that the fact that the

1052
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:20,749
yom kevuah represents philosophically
the antithesis of the Shabbat idea.

1053
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:31,159
The latter, the Shabbat idea, stresses
human liberation from society.

1054
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,695
Human withdraw from society.

1055
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:40,135
A movement of recoil away from
society into one's individuality,

1056
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,805
into one's own private world.

1057
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:51,580
And Shabbat characterizes
or is representative

1058
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:58,286
of complete immersion of the
individual in himself and

1059
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:01,890
consequently in the Almighty as

1060
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,525
a lonely being.

1061
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:10,665
Yamim kevu'im emphasize 
the opposite motif.

1062
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,936
What does Yom Tov mean?

1063
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,472
Yom kadosh,

1064
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:22,077
semantically, simply if we'll
take Hebrew semantics, means what?

1065
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,081
The holiday, what more -- I said
what holiday stands for in Hebrew.

1066
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:31,119
A separate day, an isolated day,
a unique day, a singular day.

1067
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,924
It means the day on which the
individual reaches out for

1068
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:39,561
singularity, not for universality.

1069
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:47,335
For uniqueness, for aloneness, from being
different, from being like -- not like

1070
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:52,040
others, a day of self-immersion.

1071
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:58,613
That means self-introspection,
inner-directedness, if I want to use a

1072
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,917
colloquial term, a day of being alone.

1073
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:02,651
This is kedushah.

1074
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:03,985
Kedushah means being alone.

1075
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:07,222
Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh, being remote.

1076
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,091
What does Yom Tov mean?

1077
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:13,929
What is Yom Tov?

1078
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,030
What does that mean semantically?

1079
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,965
Translation in English,
what does it mean, Yom Tov?

1080
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,133
What does Yom Tov mean?

1081
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,970
Might be -- tov in Hebrew has
actually two connotations.

1082
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,738
Tov might be pleasant.

1083
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,507
Pleasant.

1084
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:29,577
We just read last Shabbos, "Tovas
mareh," doesn't mean Rivkah

1085
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:34,082
was kind, but tovas mareh means

1086
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:36,785
the appearance was pleasing.

1087
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,286
Fine.

1088
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,789
And then there is tov means kindness.

1089
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,793
Whatever, I don't care, Yom Tov means
a day of kindness, a kind day or a

1090
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:51,800
pleasant day, but pleasant and kindness
can only be imagined within society.

1091
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,237
No one -- man in isolation
cannot be pleasant.

1092
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:58,039
Pleasant to whom?

1093
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:01,042
Man, no.

1094
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,411
Can man, in isolation, be kind?

1095
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,980
Kind to whom?

1096
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:10,785
Robinson Crusoe could not be
kind, nor could he be pleasant.

1097
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,555
It already describes a
certain relationship.

1098
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,992
I am pleasant in my relationship
to others, but I cannot

1099
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,860
be pleasant to myself.

1100
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:23,064
Yom Tov, when we say,

1101
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,403
represents the opposite idea of Shabbos.

1102
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:35,076
It's a day of commonness, of mutual
participation, a day of tearing

1103
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:41,483
down all fences, of erasing all
boundaries, of leveling off all

1104
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:44,953
distinctiveness, separating man from man.

1105
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,588
It's a day of sharing.

1106
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:54,963
Not the individual but the
community is the hero of the day.

1107
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:59,167
The merger of the individual
with the community.

1108
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:03,838
On Shabbos, the individual
withdraws from the community

1109
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:10,979
and on Yom Tov, a yom kavuah, the
individual unites with the community.

1110
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,117
On Purim and Chanukah, there is no
issur melachah because issur melachah

1111
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:18,119
represents a different idea, like I said.

1112
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,457
However, there is a precept
of simchah v'hallel.

1113
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,195
While issur melachah represents

1114
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:32,600
the isolation
of the individual, as I explained before,

1115
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,771
simchah v'hallel is indicative of the
union of individual and community.

1116
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:43,611
There is no simchah halachically, unless there is sharing.

1117
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:48,149
Whenever you say simchah halachically,

1118
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:53,288
it means you rejoice but gladden
the hearts of others as well.

1119
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,391
Make others rejoice.

1120
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,159
That cannot be halachically.

1121
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,630
I'm not speaking now in homiletics,
in terms of -- in homiletical terms.

1122
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,399
I'm speaking in pure halachic terms.

1123
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:09,504
There is no simchah
unless many are involved.

1124
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:13,775
And if, for instance, something
happens which makes me happy,

1125
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,111
why should someone else be happy?

1126
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:21,015
So I have to try my best to
involve somebody, the thou

1127
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,152
in my happiness, in my joy.

1128
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:30,792
And I believe when I said -- I spoke last
time here, this a tradition as old as

1129
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:38,399
our mother, Sarah, the one who initiated
that tradition, that simchah and sharing

1130
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:41,269
are synonymous or identical is Sarah.

1131
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:48,476
When she received the 
greatest gift, Isaac.

1132
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:52,547
“Tz'chok asah
li Elokim," God made me rejoice.

1133
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:57,719
He bestowed upon me the most beautiful,
the most precious gift, but I can

1134
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:02,257
only rejoice if kol ha'shomei'a
yitzchak li," that whoever will

1135
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:07,962
hear the good news will rejoice
with me, otherwise there is no joy.

1136
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,531
Interesting ideas.

1137
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:15,503
The Gemara in Moed Katan calls simchah
"simchah d'rabim." Any kind of joy

1138
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:19,040
must be shared by the multitude.

1139
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:26,714
There is no simchah unless
there is sharing, unless one's

1140
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:33,321
existence becomes suddenly
unbounded, open and all-embracing.

1141
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:38,960
The Bible never fails to mention,
whenever it speaks of simchah, that

1142
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:44,732
one has to share his blessings
with somebody else, "Atah u'vincha

1143
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:49,771
u'vitecha v'avdecha va'amasecha
v'ha'ger asher bi'sharecha",

1144
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:53,274
"Ki ein l'chelek v'nachalah
imach," make him rejoice.

1145
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:59,881
The Megillah urges the people to
celebrate Purim by feasting and

1146
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:06,321
sending gifts to acquaintances and, in
particularly, and presents to the poor.

1147
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:13,928
On Chanukah, it's not the sharing
what he -- there is sharing on Purim.

1148
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:14,796
It's a day of sharing.

1149
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:20,101
As a matter of fact, the whole
institution of tzedakah on Purim

1150
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:23,705
differs from the universal institution
of tzedakah the rest of the year.

1151
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,206
There are basic differences.

1152
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:29,277
For instance, you have social -- there
are many social workers here.

1153
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:36,517
You know that mother and child cannot be
given just anyone who will ask for help.

1154
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:37,919
You investigate.

1155
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:41,789
Of course, in certain respects, we
agree with the mother in theory that

1156
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,491
you investigate before you give.

1157
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,727
However, on Purim, there
is no investigation.

1158
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:50,832
"Kol ha'poshet yad," whoever stretches
out his hand should be given.

1159
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:55,470
It's a different kind -- because
the day -- the essence of the

1160
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,672
day expresses itself in sharing.

1161
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:05,613
Chanukah is not sharing of
material goods, but there is

1162
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,916
sharing of Hallel or of sharing in

1163
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,118
the joy of the nes.

1164
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:15,657
The Ner Chanukah is always kindled in
the doorway, not inside of the house.

1165
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,158
Never.

1166
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,695
You know, we don't kindle Ner
Chanukah in the doorway, so you do

1167
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:24,899
it -- we light it on the windowsill.

1168
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,468
Ner Chanukah has got to be seen.

1169
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:31,973
If I raise the Ner Chanukah
above 20 amos, I mean, is

1170
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:36,911
the -- so my action is worthless.

1171
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:37,745
Why?

1172
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:45,453
Because simchah v'hallel can only
be achieved if man is ready to share

1173
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:47,088
whatever he has.

1174
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:55,697
And particularly Chanukah and Purim actually represent one idea.

1175
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:59,834
I told you the idea of the community,
the individual within the community,

1176
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:04,806
not outside the community and
particularly, it represents what?

1177
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,107
What?

1178
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:10,211
Common destiny.

1179
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:17,785
If the individual is in the community,
then he experiences common destiny.

1180
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:20,888
Individual in the community is not
only a metaphysical, existential

1181
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:23,091
term, it's a historical term.

1182
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:27,528
When the individual is immersed in
the community, then he knows that

1183
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:28,763
he's no exception to the rule.

1184
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:32,934
If the community can suffer, so he also.

1185
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:38,106
He is not like Job, who thought the
whole world is exposed, vulnerable, but

1186
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:42,477
my children are not vulnerable because
every Sunday morning, I get up and I

1187
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:47,882
bring seven burnt-offerings and they'll
be protected no matter what will happen

1188
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,151
to the world or to the community.

1189
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:51,886
Well, they didn't, though.

1190
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:58,826
Suddenly, a tornado was unleashed
and the tornado has destroyed many

1191
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:03,297
homes and among the many homes which
were destroyed by the tornado, in a

1192
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:09,237
funny way, Job's home was among them.

1193
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:17,111
So Chanukah and Purim in a yom kavuah
is b'reshus ha'rabim reigns supreme.

1194
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,447
On Shabbos, b'reshus ha'yachid.

1195
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:25,586
A common destiny of all is
the motto of the yom kavuah.

1196
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,389
The individual is not hated.

1197
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,125
The single Jew is not hated.

1198
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:36,564
The community is the target of hatred,
but you cannot beat the community,

1199
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,499
so you select the single Jew.

1200
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:42,770
The community is the target
of hostility and persecution.

1201
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,507
The individual cannot escape that destiny

1202
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:55,116
and likewise, salvation, when
it comes, it includes many.

1203
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:59,253
It's very seldom when salvation
comes just to one individual.

1204
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:04,258
And if it does come, he should right
away share in his happiness with others.

1205
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:05,827
This is yom kavuah.

1206
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:07,762
There is no issur melachah.

1207
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:11,232
On the contrary, work is
the symbol of cooperation.

1208
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:15,470
There is matanos
l'evyonim, v'samachta atah.

1209
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,370
Who?

1210
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,672
There is a Vav hamechaber.

1211
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:20,775
You, "and", that

1212
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:23,110
is the symbol of Chanukah and Purim.

1213
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:32,019
All that can be understood against a certain

1214
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,190
theological background.

1215
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:45,199
There are two possibilities
concerning God and man's relationship

1216
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,603
within the realm of history.

1217
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:54,909
It is almost taken for granted

1218
01:31:56,277 --> 01:32:09,323
That God uses man from time to time as
an instrument in order to execute or

1219
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:12,927
to fulfill His inscrutable will.

1220
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:14,962
[audio gap]

1221
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:23,671
There are actually, I mean, not two
relationships between God and man but

1222
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:29,544
three relationships.

1223
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:41,789
God does not use man as the fulfiller or
executer of God's inscrutable will at all.

1224
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:44,025
Sometimes God acts all

1225
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,626
by Himself.

1226
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,062
All by himself.

1227
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:55,236
God does not use man as the fulfiller
and executer of God's inscrutable will.

1228
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,306
God does everything by Himself.

1229
01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:03,911
God Himself decrees and
fulfills His own decree.

1230
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:10,918
Man's role in such cases, in
such situations, equals zero.

1231
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:15,056
Man has not been assigned any role.

1232
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:16,357
In certain cases, man is not assigned

1233
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,792
any role.

1234
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:24,498
The initiative is God, and the
realization is His as well.

1235
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:32,807
All man can do in such a case is
to watch, to admire and to adore.

1236
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,379
What case is it?

1237
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,816
Of course, there was no
man at all in creation.

1238
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:44,452
Creation, which is celebrated on the

1239
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:51,892
Sabbath, is an act which was completely
planned, devised and executed by

1240
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:53,094
the Almighty.

1241
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:53,861
There was no man.

1242
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,897
Man was created on Friday

1243
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:02,303
as the final being, the final product.

1244
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,639
And Chazal ask, why on Friday?

1245
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,674
Why wasn't man created on the first day?

1246
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:12,747
So, because man -- if man were created on
the first day, he would claim partnership.

1247
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:18,853
He would say that he was a
co-creator with the Almighty.

1248
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:25,126
But anyway, creation is -- man
was not involved in creation.

1249
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:29,263
God is the creator and
sustainer of the cosmos.

1250
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,232
Man has no share in that power.

1251
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:35,603
God -- there's another case.

1252
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,872
God uses man

1253
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,342
not for consummation

1254
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:50,317
and execution of His will,
but for holding the message.

1255
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:53,354
Man is used as a prophet.

1256
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:59,293
He's not involved in God's
action, but he carries God's word.

1257
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:05,066
He brings the good tidings to the people,
for who will say God engages in action.

1258
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:10,137
He tells the people, the downtrodden
and the unfortunate ones to be

1259
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:13,808
liberated by God, that God is
about to execute, I mean, His

1260
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:20,948
promise, but he himself does not
participate in divine action.

1261
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:22,183
He's not a partner.

1262
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:28,622
Man acts as the shaliach, as
the messenger or angel of God.

1263
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:30,224
He carries the instructions.

1264
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:32,927
This role

1265
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:38,232
was assigned to -- this was 
the role of Moses.

1266
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:43,804
He was the Navi,

1267
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:48,943
but the drama, he did not act.

1268
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:52,113
He was not the actor on
the historical stage.

1269
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:59,019
The drama was fully
realized by the Almighty.

1270
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:06,160
And that's the reason that on the night
of Passover we say, "Lo al yedei malach

1271
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,764
 v'lo al yedei shaliach ela Hakadosh Baruch Hu bichvodo u'v'atzmo."

1272
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:14,602
Whom do we exclude

1273
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:20,241
from the whole drama?

1274
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,675
Moshe.

1275
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:25,746
You know very well Moshe's name is not
mentioned on the night of Passover,

1276
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:28,215
not mentioned -- not even once.

1277
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:32,853
Sometimes, parenthetically in certain
texts, but it's just parenthetically.

1278
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:36,690
It's absolute -- his
role -- because his role was not

1279
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:43,030
of co-actor with God but as the
prophet of God, to bring the

1280
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,199
message of redemption to the people.

1281
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:53,674
Third, there is a third relationship, and
this is the most difficult relationship.

1282
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:59,747
God lets man take the initiative.

1283
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:10,791
He plans this -- man plans the struggle,
man fights for freedom, man engages in

1284
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:19,333
action and whenever man engages in action,
the latter is costly and difficult.

1285
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:23,637
And if

1286
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:29,476
God tells man to engage in action,
so the action is very difficult,

1287
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:35,182
as I said, and costly, and God
wants man to bring sacrifices.

1288
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:38,052
God wants man to play

1289
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,455
his part seriously,

1290
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:49,230
as if the final outcome
depended upon man exclusively.

1291
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:55,302
Man is allegedly the central figure.

1292
01:37:55,302 --> 01:38:02,743
Of course, God, of course, determines
the destiny and lets man either go under

1293
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:09,884
in defeat or emerge victorious, but
however, man is responsible for that.

1294
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:16,523
The struggle cannot be won
without human total involvement.

1295
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:24,098
In such cases, God demands from
man heroic action, and heroic

1296
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:26,600
action means sacrificial action.

1297
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:34,275
As far as Yetzias Mitzrayim is concerned,
man was not involved in the event.

1298
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:38,812
Man was informed and carried out some
assignments on behalf of the Almighty,

1299
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:43,050
yet he did not precipitate the events.

1300
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:50,257
He had no share in planning and
executing, therefore we proclaim at the

1301
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:52,226
Seder, "V'ani v'lo acher." 

1302
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:54,028
That's it.

1303
01:38:54,428 --> 01:39:00,834
Now, we know why Shabbat and Yomim Tovim

1304
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:09,977
prohibition against work was decreed
and on Chanukah and Purim, work is

1305
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:16,684
permitted and man has to celebrate the
day by sharing, not by withdrawing.

1306
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:17,418
Correct?

1307
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:18,385
Yes.

1308
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:23,324
Because Shabbos, particularly
Shabbos and also the holidays are

1309
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:26,060
a memorial to Yetzias Mitzrayim.

1310
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,929
All holidays are a memorial
to Yetzias Mitzrayim.

1311
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:31,565
Man had no share the actual redemption.

1312
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:33,901
Even Moses had no share in that. 

1313
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:39,039
It was planned -- not only creation
but even Yetzias Mitzrayim was

1314
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:41,709
planned and executed by the Almighty.

1315
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:48,148
Moshe was more or less the announcer
who brought the good tidings, but the

1316
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,451
drama was played by Hakadosh Baruch Hu.

1317
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:54,722
He wrote the script, the
play, He acted on the stage.

1318
01:39:57,024 --> 01:40:05,165
And as such, man has to withdraw from

1319
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:11,105
society, from work, because by withdrawing
from society and by retreating from work,

1320
01:40:11,105 --> 01:40:16,010
he withdraws from his glory, from power.

1321
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:23,283
He returns everything to God because
Shabbos creation and Yetzias Mitzrayim

1322
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:26,820
means God's full mastery over the world.

1323
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:32,359
Man is helpless and man cannot do
anything in order to accelerate the

1324
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:37,297
fulfillment of his destiny in order
to bring about redemption sooner.

1325
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:38,799
He can't do that.

1326
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:43,337
However, Chanukah and Purim, very strange.

1327
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:47,141
Purim is still a Biblical
holiday, more or less.

1328
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:50,377
Chanukah is not a Biblical holiday at all.

1329
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:52,613
I mean, there is no text to Chanukah.

1330
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:58,352
As Chazal say, prophecy disappeared.

1331
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,958
It's only there was just people were
inspired by Ruach Ha'Kodesh, yes.

1332
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:14,768
And so, in such a situation, God calls
upon man to act, to plan, to take the

1333
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:19,840
initiative and to fulfill and to realize.

1334
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:27,347
I mean, man's role expresses itself in
total involvement with the community.

1335
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:30,317
In the readiness to sacrifice, this

1336
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:33,620
was true of Esther, it was
true of the Chashmona'im.

1337
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,155
They sacrificed.

1338
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:37,591
The nes happened later.

1339
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:43,764
When the sacrifices were brought,
we know very well they engaged the

1340
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:51,071
so-called Seleucids or the -- in battle
many times and if there is a battle,

1341
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,873
people lose their lives, I mean.

1342
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:58,745
Now we speak about the nitzchonos,
the victories of the Chashmona'im,

1343
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:01,281
but before a victory is won, there are

1344
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:04,418
many sacrifices over here.

1345
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:12,459
And so, when -- an event in which
the community -- man is involved,

1346
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:19,933
then it leads to a different kind
of celebration, not of celebrating

1347
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:25,539
the event in loneliness, alone, but
on the contrary, in celebrating the

1348
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:31,845
event by the individual who merges
with the community because altogether

1349
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:34,948
made it possible, the nes possible.

1350
01:42:35,849 --> 01:42:44,825
And the symbol of the day is instead
of -- is not prohibition against work.

1351
01:42:45,225 --> 01:42:49,730
This engagement, on the
contrary, withdrawal of

1352
